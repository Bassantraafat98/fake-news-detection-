The sudden change follows complaints from President Trump about his hair routine.

“So golden showers – you take a golden shower, the urine doesn’t come out. You want to wash your hands, the urine doesn’t come out. So what do you do? You just stand there longer or you take a golden shower longer? Because my hair – I don’t know about you, but it has to be perfect. Perfect,” Trump probably said.

In a soon to be released tell-all by Trumps former fixer/attorney, Michael Cohen, Cohen confirms Trumps affinity to the golden shower stating “From golden showers in a sex club in Vegas, to tax fraud, to deals with corrupt officials from the former Soviet Union, to catch and kill conspiracies to silence Trump’s clandestine lovers, I wasn’t just a witness to the president’s rise—I was an active and eager participant.”

Consumer and urine conservation groups argue such changes are wasteful and unnecessary.

Bill Samuals, executive director of the urine conservation group Urine Awareness Project, called the proposal “silly,” adding “you could have 2 or 3 ladies pissing on your face at once pushing out 8-10 gallons of urine per minute, seems excessive.”

“If the president needs help finding a good golden shower, we can point him to some great websites that help you identify ladies with a heavier flow that would provide a dense soak and a good golden shower,” he added.

She didn’t have to. The way the slightly overweight feminist apologetically paused, fought back tears, and forced out a simple, “Stuff happened there,” told the story of the pain she’s been carrying since she first started fighting for gender equality almost two years ago.

Bradley’s troubles reached an apex the day she organized an anti-Donald Trump rally in Lubbock, Texas. Prudence and a group of fellow UW-M students made the long trek from Madison, WI, to protest Trump’s treatment of women in the Lone Star State.

Almost an hour into their protest, a man wearing a Make America Great Again hat and confederate flag suspenders approached her and screamed “feminazi f*ck pig” right to her face. For Mrs. Bradley, it was like being shot point blank in the face with a high-capacity assault weapon.

“I was in a state of total shock,” said Bradley, “I couldn’t feel my legs and thought I may have been paralyzed.” After being treated at a local medical facility for minor emotional distress, Prudence caught the first flight back home to seek a second opinion.

“Prudence was showing all the classic symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD,” said Dr. Liam Williams, Bradley’s family doctor in Madison. “Re-experiencing the trauma through intrusive and distressing recollections of the event, flashbacks, and nightmares are just some of Mrs. Bradley’s symptoms,” warned the doctor. “Prudence was also showing extreme emotional numbness that puts her in a very dangerous category of PTSD. It’s very important she start a treatment program immediately.”

The Bradley family researched treatment facilities across the country, hoping to find a program that would give their daughter the best overall chance at a full recovery. After almost a month of searching, the family were losing hope until an email from a wounded slacktivist suggested they call the Wounded Social Justice Warrior Project® in Portland, Oregon.

The program provides personalized care, services, and advocacy to seriously wounded social justice warriors—including those who have suffered post traumatic stress disorder and other medical health conditions.

Besides adaptive and rehabilitative programs and caregiver support, the WSJWP also provides mentorship to recovering activists, an employment and career readiness program, and financial assistance for those who have suffered or aggravated an injury or illness and need help with daily living activities so they can avoid being hospitalized or put in an outpatient care facility.

For Prudence, the WSJWP has been a blessing. After a difficult and challenging three months in the program, Mrs. Bradley is starting to feel whole again, and is even looking forward to rejoining her fellow moonbats in time to protest the Republican National Convention next month in Jacksonville.

“I’ll be back,” said Mrs. Bradley with a new found sense of confidence. “I refuse to let these misogynists have the last laugh. This time I’ll be ready for them.” Prudence praises the WSJWP for giving her a second chance, not only at life, but a new sense of purpose to fight for social and economic justice. “This is my passion and I will never give up, ever.”

About the Wounded Social Justice Warrior Project®

The mission of the Wounded Social Justice Warrior Project® is to honor and empower our wounded heroes. Its purpose is to raise awareness of injured social activists, to help find them aid, and to provide unique, direct programs and services to help them continue with their activism. WSJWP is a national, nonpartisan organization headquartered in Portland, Oregon.

6,https://nationalreport.net/trump-university-study-finds-correlation-between-menthol-cigarettes-and-voter-fraud/,2020-07-19T11:40:10+00:00,Nationalreport,"New York City, NY – As Donald Trump takes on the Republican establishment, Democrats and the mainstream media, he’s telling supporters they’re fighting against a “rigged” system, rife with voter fraud. The left, predictably, say talk like this is “dangerous” to the integrity of our electoral system, and then glibly ask for Mr. Trump to prove his voter fraud allegations.

Ask and ye shall receive.

Donald Trump’s campaign released a new study today that found a direct link between menthol cigarettes and widespread voter fraud.

Conducted by researchers at Trump University, the comprehensive study titled The Menthol Menace determined that menthol smokers have a genetic predisposition to commit in-person voter impersonation fraud.

“We found robust evidence that confirms a correlation between menthol cigarettes and voter fraud,” said Trump’s campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway. “Once again Mr. Trump is 100% vindicated. Let’s see if the dishonest media will even report on this. I won’t be holding my breath.”

In typical fashion, progressives were quick to suggest that the study’s findings were somehow “racist” and dismissed them without further review. “Liberals want you to believe that only blacks smoke menthol cigarettes and therefore the findings are flawed and even racist. I think the American people are smarter than that,” Conway said.

Studies have shown that almost one in five African Americans smoke menthol cigarettes, almost three times the rate of whites.

Federal courts have time and again struck down sensible voter ID laws, concluding that minority voters are less likely to own a car and therefore less likely to obtain a driver’s license that could be used as an acceptable form of ID.

“Now that is racist…and total hogwash,” says former Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker. “If these people can’t obtain an ID then how are they buying all those menthol cigarettes they love so much? Answer me that.” Mr. Walker cited unverified claims of illegal immigrants voting over and over again at different polling locations using multiple fake IDs. “We must go further than strict voter ID laws, that’s why I am working on legislation that would require every Wisconsinite submit to an iris scan before they cast their ballot,” said Walker.

A similar study done by the Wyoming Institute of Technology found a direct link between menthol cigarettes and gang violence. The study found that gang violence was 16 times more likely to occur within a 5-mile radius of what the institute called “Menthol Center Zones.” The Menthol Menace concluded that polling stations within these “Menthol Center Zones” are likely to attract the highest concentration of fraudulent voters and should be heavily monitored on election day.

7,https://nationalreport.net/trump-administration-to-launch-black-beans-matter-campaign/,2020-07-15T19:09:58+00:00,Nationalreport,"<Washington, DC>The Trump Administration has launched a “Black Beans Matter” (“Frijoles Negros Importan”) campaign in support of a Goya Foods whose top executive was criticized last week for supporting President Trump. The campaign is focused on increasing sales of Mexican owned Goya food brands, as well as securing Latino votes for the upcoming election.

Critics of the president have been calling for a boycott of Goya after CEO Robert Unanue stated “We’re all truly blessed at the same time to have a leader like President Trump, who is a builder” at a White House event. Unanue continued, “”He came to this country to build, to grow, to prosper. And so we have an incredible builder, and we pray for our leadership, our president, and we pray for our country that we will continue to prosper and to grow.””

The president’s daughter, who serves as a formal adviser to the president in the White House, tweeted late Tuesday in both English and Spanish along with a photo of her posing with can of black beans in support of the upcoming campaign.

The president again commented on the controversy Wednesday with the following tweet:

Critics of the president, as well as ethics officials, have criticized the move citing federal ethics law that states, in part, “An employee’s position or title should not be used to coerce; to endorse any product, service or enterprise; or to give the appearance of governmental sanction.” The Trump campaign has notoriously ignored the Hatch Act and this latest incident will likely be no different.

White House communications aide Carolina Hurley defended Ivanka’s tweet by stating: “Only the media and the cancel culture movement would criticize Ivanka for showing her personal support for a company that has been unfairly mocked, boycotted and ridiculed for supporting this administration — one that has consistently fought for and delivered for the Hispanic community,” adding “Ivanka is proud of this strong, Hispanic-owned business with deep roots in the U.S. and has every right to express her personal support.”

The announcement of the Black Beans Matter campaign has led to a fresh round of #BoycottGoya backlash, as well as outrage from supporters of the Black Lives Matter movement. Celebrities from Chrissy Teigen to Lin-Manuel Miranda, as well as politicians such as Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez have joined in the boycott and have used their massive platforms to draw attention to the cause.

Kushner, husband of first daughter and East Asian entrepreneuse Ivanka Trump, was named as Defendant in a lawsuit brought by Gotwood Pencil Company, alleging brand confusion between Defendant’s dick and Plaintiff’s device.

“Since January 10, 1981,” the tort alleges, “Defendant Kushner’s penis has caused Plaintiff Gotwood major financial downturns resulting in irreversible, weakened revenue streams.”

Trademark law defines “Likelihood of confusion” as the reasonable frequency to which consumers easily confuse products or services from two separate brands.

According to counsel for Plaintiff,

“Clearly, court action was necessary due to the physical similarity between Defendant Kushner’s schmekel and a bona fide pencil, with additional harm caused by false and injurious comparisons between Gottwood’s universally useful tool, and Jared C. Kushner.”

Kushner is not the only Trump family official accused of violating fair use standards and practices (nor the only one accused of having a pencil dick).

Slackjaw Industries sued Donald J. Trump, Jr. over multiple brand confusions, and second brother Eric Trump faced ugly legal action brought by The Gumline Corporation, a Slackjaw subsidiary.

Slackjaw and Gumline documents state, “this extraordinarily unattractive pair of actions was necessary to halt a significant revenue decline, hastened by the appearance of Defendant Eric Trump as warm up comic during a recent Tulsa, Oklahoma Trump campaign rally.

Trump branded businesses have initiated over 3,500 legal actions in U.S. federal and state courts.

The volume of legal actions bestows upon all Trump family enterprises the designation of Major American Suers.

Kushner has not publicly issued comment on Gottwood’s allegations. Repeated press attempts have failed to initiate a response.

While Virginia has long struggled with racism, momentum in support of the blackface community really picked up this week after a racist photograph surfaced on the yearbook page of Governor Ralph Northam. Northam has denied being in the photograph, but his denial fell flat after he confessed to having dressed in blackface for a Texas dance competition where he impersonated Michael Jackson by painting his face with shoe polish.

Fresh off the Northam news, Attorney General Mark Herring, second in line to assume the governorship of the Commonwealth, today admitted to dressing in blackface when he was a 19-year-old college student at the University of Virginia in 1980. Herring, who was among those calling on Northam to resign, said he was “deeply, deeply sorry for the paint that I cause with this revelation.”

Virginia’s Lt. Governor Justin Fairfax, widely considered for the position of Governor in the event Northam resigns, has found himself in the midst of sexual assault allegations. No word on whether or not Democrats in the state will support his candidacy following the allegations.

National Report reached out to the head of the Virginia Legislative Blackface Caucus, but no response was provided prior to publication.

Donald J. Trump, fresh from a second contentious Oval Office meeting with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, wasted no time blaming both Democrats for the breakdown in negotiations designed to bring an end to the federal government’s shutdown, now entering its third week.

“Donald Trump’s done the impossible,” said Capitol Hill pundit Althea Thoone. “He’s painted himself into a corner in a room that has no corners – the Oval Office!”

Sen. Chuck Schumer called the President’s latest behavior a temper tantrum. “Unfortunately, the president just got up and walked out,” Schumer told a throng of waiting reporters. Trump reportedly threw papers on the floor and stormed away after Speaker Pelosi again denied Trump funding for his border wall.

The shutdown has been a particularly sticky wicket for the president, particularly after the trio’s first meeting, when Trump, seated beside a stoic Vice President Pence, told the two Democratic leaders that he would take the blame for the shutdown.

“He’s painted a picture of himself as this border security warrior,” said Thoone, “but he’s bristled during recent meetings with Pelosi and Schumer because of his refusal to back down on his principal campaign promise — to build the wall.”

The turkeys, “Eric” and “Don Jr.”, will hopefully live out the rest of their days in obscurity after avoiding life sentences for their part in conspiring with a hostile foreign government to influence the 2016 Presidential election, obstructing justice and committing light treason (allegedly).

Mr. Trump will be announcing the pardons during a ceremony taking place in the White House Rose Garden. Melania and Barron will likely be in attendance.

This years pardons come on the heals of multiple pardons provided for equally jive-ass turkeys over the past two years by the Trump administration including disgraced former Maricopa County sheriff Joe Arpaio, serial perjurer Lewis “Scooter” Libby, and token foreign Conservative Dinesh D’ouza.

Other jive-ass turkeys likely being considered for pardons include Roger Stone Jr., General Michael Flynn, Jarod Kushner, Ivanka Trump, Paul Manafort and Rick Gates. The President is said to be discussing a preemptive pardon for himself as well.

According to legal professionals the pardoning of jive-ass turkeys at the federal level does nothing to protect them from being prosecuted at the state level.

13,https://nationalreport.net/5-great-ways-entertain-guests-thanksgiving-celebration/,2017-11-23T15:00:30+00:00,Nationalreport,"For those of you who are actively avoiding the Black Friday Shopping frenzy, and actually looking forward to spending meaningful time with your family and friends, National Report has lovingly put together a list of new and unique ways to create memorable experiences during this year’s Thanksgiving celebration.

Surprise Thanksgiving Roasts

One great way to involve folks in holiday oriented entertainment is to make the tried-and-true Thanksgiving meal into an unwitting scavenger hunt! Similar to the traditional Mardi Gras King’s cake, in which a small coin or figure of baby Jesus is hidden inside, we recommend you hide something small or unexpected inside of at least one of the main dishes or desserts. Staff picks include a set of false teeth submerged in Great Aunt Muriel’s homemade cherry cheesecake, or a modest bag of mixed prescription medication concealed in the mashed potatoes.

Once these unanticipated objects have been discovered, announce the finder as the subject of a brutal holiday roast! This game is a hilarious idea for all-inclusive entertainment, as everyone can criticize and berate the winner under the pretense of light-hearted ribbing, providing hours of amusement, and an acceptable excuse to dish out both emotional abuse, while creating fond memories for years to come.

Truth Or Dare

Do you suspect your family and/or friends are holding out on some dark secrets or privy to juicy need-to-know gossip? Well, there’s no better way to really know your loved ones more intimately than to play an alcohol-fueled variant of truth or dare, also known as Spin the Bottle! If alcohol may not be effective for the family that already regularly drinks together, just use the CIA’s favorite truth serum, Scopolamine, and spike their drinks.

Of course, children must be excluded from this game due to its adult themes, so I suggested you shut them away in a distant room as to prevent any trauma due to all the familial skeletons figuratively pouring out of the closet. Who knew that Aunt Terri actually DID get rid of Uncle Berry for his $100,000 life insurance policy, and that he wasn’t simply a victim of an unfortunate, and unsolved hit-and-run accident? You never know what you might learn about your family’s history!

Outdoor Scavenger Hunt

Like most Thanksgiving celebrations, it is likely your guests have had at least two other meals under their belt before the main event. Consequently, in order to work up a genuine appetite for your Thanksgiving spread, have them embark on a harrowing scavenger hunt through a rented corn maze! (The bigger, the better.) Not only will it make them feel genuinely thankful for all the work you’ve done to host this holiday event but also provide you with enough time to actually finish the cooking!

Provide your party with a flare gun and a small flashlight in case they get lost in the maze, or are unable to understand the clues you’ve dispersed randomly around the cornfield. That way they can find each other, and hopefully signal for help as darkness falls. The first ones out of the maze get to have the initial choice of their favorite foods, while the last to finish have to wash all the dishes, providing them with plenty of incentive to participate!

Cosplay

Our next suggestion is to recreate an authentic Thanksgiving holiday by cosplaying as your favorite pilgrims from the Mayflower, complete with costumes and a vastly limited spread of food reminiscent of a meager Paleolithic diet. Hire real Native Americans to sit alongside your family and eat with you, just as they had with the pilgrims!

Keep it traditional by trading them in dried corn, glass beads, and firewater for their service, and insist that they too attend the meal in historically accurate attire, such as leather loincloths, feathered headbands and a necklace of real human scalps.

Invite The Homeless

Turn your house into a surprise soup kitchen for the disenfranchised and unfortunate without informing your guests before they arrive!

Before turning your homestead into an impromptu food trough for the poor and downtrodden, it is highly recommended that you put up chicken wire to prevent them from getting into undesirable areas, such as your organic tomato garden, underwear drawer or medicine cabinet.

Thanksgiving is full of human-interest pieces and Facebook images about selfless individuals providing hot meals to the needy on a day known for generosity and goodwill. Bring this instant karmic good luck to you and all your loved ones by getting them unknowingly involved with your philanthropic endeavors. Put them on the spot as they are surrounded by shambling drug addicts and the streams of urine left in their wake. They will not be able to refuse an opportunity to brag about their charitable and selfless holiday on the nearest social media platform, especially before starting their Black Friday binge shopping!

14,https://nationalreport.net/study-claims-women-abandon-feminism-finding-meaningful-relationships-men/,2017-11-14T16:00:05+00:00,Nationalreport,"Women who remain die-hard feminists well into adulthood are oftentimes the least desirable specimens, science now claims.

“The only relationships they have are often ones with other females who subscribe to the same strict ideologies, and serve as echo chambers for extremist thought. The stereotype of overweight, unattractive, bitter, resentful hags with a chip on their shoulder isn’t really too far from the truth,” said Sheila Baker, director of the Garrison Institute located in Langford, Mississippi.

“Women who quickly abandon feminism are just happier in the long run,” Harman told National Report. “Once they engage in a healthy relationship with a member of the opposite sex, 78% of women realize that they had been brainwashed via college campuses and social media. They’re ashamed of having associated with a mob of mentally-ill whiners and seek to distance themselves from that lifestyle as much as possible.”

After graduating high school, Sheila Baker was accepted into at a well-known liberal college located in the Pacific Northwest, attended primarily by the offspring of affluent families. Even then, feminism was the social justice ’cause du jour’ amongst bleeding-heart upper class young adults with no worldly perspective or experience. “It’s true. I identified as a feminist in college,” Baker blushingly confessed. “It’s really rather embarrassing to admit now. I marched in the marches. I blogged with the best of them. I was full of entitlement and resentment towards what I thought at the time was the source of all the world’s ills: The Patriarchy. In particular, white males. The only real exposure I had to the less fortunate was through my textbooks. Instructors basically fanned the flames by telling us that all sources of oppression and strife within’ the world were due to privileged Caucasians.

You get a bunch of impressionable white kids together who are in a rebellious frame of mind and tell them that the families they grew up with are basically responsible for everything that is wrong with the world and I can guarantee the outcome is not going to be a healthy one.”

And the horror stories don’t stop there says Sheila, who claims she has heard thousands of stories which ring similarly to her own. And far too many of those tales result in permanent damage to the woman, her personal life, and familial relationships.

Barker went on to elaborate upon one particular instance in which a woman became so wrapped up in feminism that she was disowned by her family, eventually leading to her untimely demise at the hands of an intentional overdose.

“We’ll call this woman K.C. out of respect,” Sheila began. “We were close friends in college, and even by my own admittedly very liberal standards, she was quite extreme. Always talking about how men should be castrated and put in labor camps. She updated her social media with misandrist hate speech, and even went onto violently attack her younger brother when he accidentally misgendered one of her friends.

During this time K.C. intentionally gained 200 pounds in what she called her fight against beauty stereotypes. What was once a beautiful, attractive young girl had permanently mutilated herself with facial tattoos, piercings, and morbid obesity.”

Sheila Baker will be releasing her findings in an upcoming interview with OUT Magazine, as well as a 30 state tour to sign the accompanying book which goes into even more detail as to why young women fall into the treacherous trap of liberalism, and how to reclaim their lives from commie parasites, and other damaging ideologies which prey on a misguided desire to make the world a better place, all while paving the hell.

The Washington Post broke the story stating the then 32 year-old Moore pursued a sexual relationship with Leigh Corfman outside a courtroom in Etowah County, Alabama in 1979.

The allegation, which includes 3 additional women between the ages of 16 and 18 and is supported by as many as 30 sources, sent shockwaves through the Republican Party forcing many high-ranking officials to respond on the record. Discussion quickly turned to the possibility of replacing Moore on the ballot, however Alabama law prohibits the replacement of a party candidate up to 76 days before the election.

Dan Stevens, a spokesman for the Alabama secretary of state’s office told National Report Thursday the role of Moore will instead be played by actor Christopher Plummer. Plummer recently became a hot Hollywood commodity after he was chosen to replace another alleged pedophile, Kevin Spacey, in the upcoming file “All the Money in the World.” He can, however, get all the money in the world by reading National Debt Relief reviews and more. It may not give him all the money in the world, but it sure is a great resource to help consolidate debt that can afford you more financial freedom.

Moore has denied the allegations and has taken to social media to blame the mainstream media, along with the “National Democratic Party” for what he considers to be a smear campaign.

National Report reached out to representatives for Mr. Plummer, but no response was received prior to publication.

After spending his entire life dwelling in the basement of his mother’s home, she had finally become fed up with her unmotivated son and gave Hollingsworth the boot.

The unemployed 35-year-old who has never lived on his own was clearly distressed when I spoke with him Wednesday. “She’s destroyed my life”, he exclaimed bitterly, staring at the photo in his clenched fist; A photograph of his family during happier times.

Duane has 3 younger siblings who have since gone on with their lives and become successful, driven adults, but Duane’s life just never seemed to take off. He remained content with frittering away his days playing video games and watching anime cartoons; Things that are mostly enjoyed by children. Duane is an adult male who just absolutely refuses to grow up.

After the death of Duane’s father 2 years ago, his mother Janice gave him an ultimatum: Either get a full-time job, enroll in college, or find somewhere else to live. After a handful of paltry attempts to secure employment at various fast-food establishments, it was clear that Duane would rather spend his time nestled among My Little Pony figurines in a musky basement than actually work for a living.

“It was clear he wasn’t serious about making a living for himself”, Janice explained. “He always had some excuse and frankly all these excuses were wearing very thin. I just wanted him out so I could enjoy retirement after having lost my husband. He was becoming an enormous financial burden and didn’t seem to care. Duane wouldn’t budge. He would frequently lash out and blame his siblings and myself for his lot in life.”

Eventually the moment of reckoning finally arrived in January of this year. Janice gave Duane 30 days to find somewhere else to live. “It was 30 days of pure hell. He stormed around the house screaming and crying. I could not believe what a spoiled brat he was at 35 years years of age! He always resented me for having more children after he was born. I suppose he just thought he would be the baby forever, but that clearly is not a healthy way for an adult to live.”

Duane finally found a tiny trailer for rent on the outskirts of town. He is currently supporting himself by selling off his vintage action figures and other collectibles on Ebay. He has also began taking steps to sue his own mother for damages, pain and suffering, emotional trauma and illegal eviction, all to the tune of 750k.

“I have PTSD now”, he exclaimed during our short interview. Duane sat across from me looking distressed and disheveled, wearing grimy gray sweatpants and a threadbare Power Rangers t-shirt which was clearly too small for his hulking frame. “My mother is going to pay for kicking me out! I had squatter’s rights! That was my lifelong home and my mother did nothing but torture me the whole time I was there! My parents neglected me when my other siblings were born so I totally deserve to stay there as long as I want! Nobody knows the hell I have endured!”

When questioned about the impending lawsuit being served up by her own son, Janice just shakes her head. “He only has himself to blame for his situation and obviously, he’s going to lose. Our only crime was being too nice and enabling this sort of behavior. Unfortunately, by coddling a weakling for far too long, I created a monster.”

Trump.

The new Trojan Ultra-Thin Skin Scum Bag© will be available for a limited time and sold exclusively to novelty shops and truck stops nationwide. The Scum Bag© will come in two different shades of orange, regular & extra-dark, and be marketed towards “the small hands kinda guy.”

Trojan President Hugh Jardon said his company does not normally mix business with politics, but sees an opportunity to cash in on America’s fascination with all things Trump, especially after the real estate mogul himself brought his penis to the foreskin of American politics.

Jardon says Trump was a “no-brainer” when his marketing team asked if he had anyone in mind for the new ultra-thin skin dunce cap. “The Donald has the thinnest skin in the world, so from a marketing standpoint it just made perfect sense.” Asked if he was worried about a possible lawsuit from Trump, Jardon is confident Trojan’s legal department “took every precaution” to avoid any legal trouble. “Unlike Mr. Trump, I don’t have the skin of a bat wing. I can handle someone who challenges me or questions my decision making.”

The new Trojan Ultra-Thin Skin Scum Bag© will compete against other similar Trump novelty condoms currently flooding the marketplace, while offering consumers a higher standard of protection. Smaller men will now have a quality product to help them “overcomb their fear of pregnancy and STD’s” while still delivering “the highest sensitivity” the condom market has ever seen.

Trump has reportedly assured NJ Governor Chris Christie that, despite recent reports, he has not been banished from his inner circle, and will nominate the Bridgegate behemoth to the Supreme Food Court.

“Mr. Trump decided it would be humorous to have his little “Christie Kreme” (his new Secret Service name, according to insiders) around, so he created the special position just for him,” says Trump’s longtime attorney/bankruptcy expert, David Friedman.

In selecting Christie, 54, The Donald will be bringing in a “yes, I’ll have another” man that won’t clash with his own oversize, portly ego. “I think Mr. Trump wants Christie around just so he can humiliate him,” said Trump’s chief financial officer, Allen Weisselberg, “and he knows he’ll do whatever he says, whenever he says to do it.”

Despite rumblings of a massive falling out between the two, those closest to the president-elect say otherwise.

Jared Kushner, the husband of Trump’s daughter Ivanka, said a Christie nomination would be a wise one, and would produce instant results. “Mr. Christie’s transition from the gravy train to the Trump train was seamless,” he said. “I think he would shake things up and make an enormous impact.”

Stephen Miller, who played a crucial role in Trump’s campaign, including drafting his acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention, says Christie has a “gargantuan-sized heart” and is “the perfect fit” for the new court.

“Governor Christie is not only ‘pro-life’, but he understands the birthing process better than anyone I know,” Miller said, “and as far as the 2nd Amendment is concerned, I’ve seen that guy conceal a .30-06 in the crease of his back fat. Trust me, there’s nothing to worry about.” Miller joked that Christie loves and supports the NRA almost as much as KFC. “He will step up to the plate, that’s for damn sure.”

While often referred to as the “butterball” of the “Grand Old Party Sub,” it appears Mr. Christie’s nomination to the Supreme Food Court is already a foregone conclusion.

The couple, John and Maggie Hillard from Manistique, Michigan, was taking a tour of the city Tuesday afternoon and taking pictures when a man suddenly appeared out of nowhere and shouted “Allahu Akbar!” (God is Great) before photobombing what would have been a very nice picture of the beautiful Amstel River.

Netherlands Prime Minister Mark Rutte was on holiday in the south of France but returned immediately for an emergency meeting with the country’s National Security Council.

“I condemn any and all photobombing,” the prime minister said. “Thoughts are with the victims of this heinous attack. We have the suspect in custody and are monitoring the situation closely.”

“Initial indications very clearly point towards terrorism,” he told the Dutch newspaper De Telegraaf.

While Mr. Hillard escaped unharmed, his wife Maggie was treated and released for minor emotional distress. It is currently unknown if the couple plan to pursue charges.

The suspect, Amir Fahdi, 39, told investigators that he too was visiting Amsterdam as a tourist and was just asking the newlyweds for directions. “We’re looking into his claims,” said lead investigator, Martyn Verhoeven.

Records show Mr. Fahdi was recently questioned by FBI officials in the U.S. after he allegedly launched a cyber attack that left an acquaintance’s inbox destroyed.

This comes amid a spate of mall attacks throughout the U.S., leaving many area shoppers and victim advocacy groups wondering how such a tasteless joke could ever make its way into print.

A spokesperson for the Fox Valley Mall told local reporters they had no knowledge of the ad and said an investigation is underway to determine where it may have originated from. However, the mall will still honor the 10% discount as advertised.

“Oh that’s a load of horsesh*t,” said a Fox Valley Mall employee who asked to remain anonymous. “There’s no way that ad just magically appeared in the Sunday paper,” he said, “this is the new age of viral marketing. Better get used to it.” The employee said the sleazy ad fits the mall owners M.O. perfectly. “They knew it would create a stir and get people talking, and that is exactly what’s happened.”

Roger Holloway, founder of the victim’s rights advocacy group Triggerz, agrees. “It’s that mentality that says anything is fair game in the name of profits. Hell, I wouldn’t put it past some of these shop owners to stage some sort of false flag attack to get the registers ringing again.”

Mr. Holloway says big chain stores like Starbucks are banking on the annual ‘War on Christmas’ hysteria to widen their year end profit margins. “They know that holiday cup and all the make-believe controversy that comes along with it is the key to their quarter’s earnings,” he said, “thank God for idiots who get offended year after year after year over a coffee cup eh?”

All calls to the investment group that owns the Fox Valley Mall have not been returned as of press time.

In the ‘Most Trustworthy’ category, Hillary scored a dismal 14% among active registered voters while Flint tap water scored a surprising 49%.





While the final tallies were a shock to many residents, MI Governor Rick Snyder isn’t surprised at all. “Well, what do you expect?” laughed Synder, “unlike the tap water in Flint, the folks here in Michigan can see right through that woman.”

Governor Snyder isn’t buying in to all the what he called “Hysterical hoopla” surrounding Flint’s water crisis, adding, “A lot of folks in Flint like to blame all of their problems on the water. We have a name for those types of people,” Snyder takes a pause for dramatic effect, “democrats.”

Oakland County resident Stanley Taylor agrees with the governor. “At some point you have to stop blaming the water for the fact your kids are dumb and lazy.” Asked if he was surprised by the survey results, Stan replied, “I would trust a fart after a Taco Bell run more than I’d ever trust Crooked Hillary.”

Past findings from the Make Michigan Great Again PAC were also critical of Mrs. Clinton’s trustworthiness. “Hillary’s lies affects children’s brain development resulting in reduced intelligence quotient (IQ), behavioral changes such as shortening of attention span, increased antisocial behavior, and reduced educational attainment. Exposure to Hillary’s falsehoods can also cause anemia, hypertension, renal impairment, immunotoxicity and toxicity to reproductive organs. The neurological and behavioral effects of Clinton’s lies are believed to be irreversible.”

The blast occurred at approximately 4:45 pm leaving the victim, Anthony Stewart, 41, physically fine but emotionally drained. “The toll is a heavy one,” said a chaplain visiting the home.

A spokesperson for the Brown County Sheriff’s Department told the Green Bay Gazette that Amir Fahdi, 39, was questioned and released after multiple witnesses said he shouted “Allahu Akbar!” (God is Great) before launching the cyber attack outside a De Pere thrift shop.

Anthony said the onslaught began with a barrage of Facebook comments and soon erupted into a full-on mind fuck of emails, text messages, and gaming requests. “I barley know the guy,” said a shaken Stewart. “I updated my Facebook status with a Nirvana video and he became unhinged.”

“The motivation behind the assault has not yet been determined,” said Chad Manning, a spokesman for the Federal Bureau of Investigation. “We are exploring all possibilities of a potential motive,” he said.

Amir blew up Anthony’s Facebook page with practically a novella’s worth of comments about seeing Nirvana play live in the early nineties and even claimed to have hung out with the band in Madison, WI, while they recorded demo tracks for their mega-smash Nevermind album. “You could tell he was full of shit, but instead of calling him out I just typed ‘wow’ and ‘awesome’ hoping he’d get the hint and leave me alone,” Stewart said, “big mistake on my part.”

News of the explosion was reported by media organizations such as Breitbart, Infowars, and Fox News. A tweet Sunday morning from Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker said: “I am deeply troubled by the bombing in De Pere. These stories cannot be swept under the rug #WIBombing.”

After several failed attempts to dodge Fahdi, a desperate Stewart told Amir he had to go care for his two-year-old son who may be coming down with a cold. “He wanted to come to my fucking house and treat him with homemade cold remedies. I was flabbergasted.”

It was then that Anthony checked his email account and discovered over 30 “ultra-rare” Nirvana MP3s had flooded his inbox. “This guy has serious issues,” said Stewart, “he may be radicalized.”

Brown County Deputy Daniel Benning said the public is not in danger and suggests that if anyone has any problems with Mr. Fahdi to simply ‘unfriend’ him and move on.

During an interview with the CBC Thursday morning, Trudeau made what some are calling an inappropriate joke about Bristol Palin while being asked about Republican Presidential front runner Donald Trump’s plan to build a wall along the Mexican border.

“I suppose Canada could build a wall around Bristol Palin’s vaginal cavity, but is that really going to stop Canadians from entering? I highly doubt it,” said Trudeau. Playing along, the interviewer asked who would pay for such a wall, with the PM adding, “How about all the fools who paid her six figures for an abstinence speech?”

A transcript of the interview was leaked to several independent media outlets, leading to an intern with CBC being fired. Trudeau’s spokesperson promptly issued an apology, stating: “The Prime Minister regrets making that analogy, and now realizes it was in poor taste. Mr. Trudeau has reached out to the Palin family to personally apologize.”

Bristol’s mother, former Governor of Alaska Sarah Palin, was quick to fire back at Trudeau via Twitter: “Thought you liberals were against slut shaming? Maybe a Canadian wall is not a bad idea. New PM is a vile looser [sic]! Boycott!!!

This is not the first time the Alaskardashians and Mr. Trudeau have crossed each other on social media. Last year when Trudeau became the second-youngest Prime Minister of Canada, Sarah blasted her neighbors of the north for electing what she called a “Liberal nightmare.” Trudeau shot back accusing Palin of being “One Brady short of a bunch,” and “a prime example why Americans need access to mental health care.”

Bristol Palin has taken online jabs at the PM on everything from accepting Syrian refugees to marijuana to abortion, even once poking fun at Trudeau for self identifying as a feminist.

However, Bristol hasn’t always been a such a harsh critic of Trudeau, once tweeting he was “smokin’ hot!” and “would ride his fuck rod” after a Twitter follower sent her a video of him stripping for charity. When pointed out the stripper’s identity, Bristol deleted the video, presumably embarrassed by the gaffe.

“As governor of Alaska, I banned Muslims from entering my daughter Bristol, and that ban is still enforced to this day,” Palin said. “Your first instinct as a parent is to protect your children, and that is what Donald Trump is trying to do, protect America from Muslim jihadists.”

Trump’s call for a “total and complete shutdown” on admitting Muslims in the U.S. drew condemnation from Republican opponents as well as Democrats. Lawmakers from both sides of the aisle criticized the plan as impractical and unconstitutional.

Speaking with the Christian Broadcast Network (CBN) to promote her latest book ‘Sweet Freedom: A Devotional’, Palin spoke on a wide range of topics including Donald Trump, being fired from Fox News, and her daughter Bristol’s passion for wild, unprotected sex.

The former Fox News commentator opened up for the first time on why she was suddenly, and without warning, fired from the popular news network. “It was a shock, you betcha. I know why it happened. I called someone out, and this someone was not happy about it, which I go into further detail in my book,” Palin said.

A source close to Fox said this “someone” is Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly. Palin criticized the media (Fox) for exploiting the Duggar girls after their brother Josh Duggar was exposed as a child predator. The unnamed source also claims Palin was “a nightmare to work with” and was often “paranoid that everyone had an agenda against her.” The source adds that Palin “was rude and a diva, and thought that everyone else paled in comparison to her intelligence and savvy.”

Bristol is also back in the news after she urged college kids to start bringing guns with them to class. “Bristol is full of energy and spunk,” Palin added, “she’s always willing to try new things.”

Word broke early, spread quickly, and sent shock waves throughout the rock and roll community and the Republican Party, where Nugent, 71, is well-known for his fierce advocacy for conservative causes, unwavering support for the rights of gun owners and hunters, and ferocious loyalty and devotion to today’s true American patriots. The National Rifle Association issued the following statement:

Ted Nugent has proudly and patriotically served on the NRA’s board of directors since 1995. The Association shares a deep sense of shock with our 4.5 million members and countless millions of supporters as details of this catastrophic event continue to unfold.

PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals), one of several organizations Nugent violently criticized in the past, also issued a statement expressing condolences.

Originally from Detroit, Michigan, Nugent initially found fame as lead guitarist for The Amboy Dukes before embarking on a solo career. Highlights from Nugent’s life include a 1977 interview appearing in High Times magazine, in which he famously told a reporter how he avoided the [Viet Nam War] draft: he did not bathe, brush his teeth, or shave for 30 days leading up to his pre-induction physical. To sweeten the pot, he also defecated in his pants. “I was so proud,” Nugent recalled. In later years he denied those accounts, saying he made up the story to trick the gullible reporter. That same year, Nugent’s song Cat Scratch Fever dominated the rock and roll charts.

President Obama, the target of many of Nugent’s negative comments, reportedly expressed astonishment when informed during a cabinet meeting that Nugent had lived another day. During the White House’s daily media briefing, Deputy Press Secretary Eric Schultz informed the assembled press corps that the President asked members of his cabinet to join him in a moment of silence to acknowledge Nugent’s survival.

Throughout Detroit and surrounding suburbs, fans both old and new erected makeshift tributes to the rocker, lighting candles, singing songs, and leaving cards and ticket stubs from many of Nugent’s concerts as testimonials to a life still lived.

** UPDATE: COSBY ADMITTED TO DRUGGING WOMEN IN 2005 DEPOSITION **

According to Ms. Taylor, she once met with Mr. Cosby decades ago at a Hollywood night club at the age of 17. As the night progressed, she became increasingly intoxicated before her boyfriend, 18 year-old Danny Stevens, helped her home where she awoke the next morning alone, with full memory of what had not transpired the night before. In a sworn statement given to officials earlier today, Ms. Taylor states, “Why was I not raped by Mr. Cosby? Was I not pretty enough? Did I do something wrong? I mean I may have been a bit overweight, but I was still rapeable (sic). These are all feelings I have struggled with since that fateful night in 1974.”









Bob Murphy, the attorney representing Ms. Taylor, had this to say, “I understand Joyce’s concerns, I mean she was in the right place at the right time, and feels she was entitled to be raped, but in a way, I think we have all been raped by Mr. Cosby.”

Since November, at least 15 women have come forward claiming to have been sexually assaulted by Cosby. Cosby, who starred as Dr. Cliff Huxtable on “The Cosby Show” from 1984 to 1992, has not been formally charged in connection with any of the allegations and has denied his involvement.

Cosby’s career has unraveled since the allegations began and he has hired an extensive team of Public Relations experts in attempt to save what is left of his reputation going so far as to blame the victims themselves.

In the years since the non-incident took place, Joyce Taylor has sought counseling and has been treated for depression. “The last forty years, my weight’s gone up and down like a yo-yo.” When “The Cosby Show” went off the air in ’92 I got things under control, but when he came back with another show four years later, I blew up like a damn balloon. Now he’s in the news again and I’m fighting the urge to ‘make the plate my mate.’ It’s a struggle,” admitted Taylor, “but I’m not going to turn not being raped by Bill Cosby into a negative.”

It is presumed there are many more Joyce Taylor’s, possibly millions, out there waiting to tell their story of not being raped by Cosby, however as of press time National Report was unable to find any additional victims. This development only leads to more confusion surrounding the multitude of accusers suggesting that they had in fact been raped by Mr. Cosby.

Cosby’s publicist David Brokaw and lawyer Martin Singer did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

38,https://nationalreport.net/solar-panels-drain-suns-energy-experts-say/,2014-05-21T21:43:32+00:00,Nationalreport,"<National Report>This week, a scientific research facility in Wyoming made a startling discovery that is certain to change the way millions of Americans look at the environmentalism movement, after they found conclusive evidence that solar panels not only convert the sun’s energy into usable energy, but that they are also draining the sun of its own energy, possibly with catastrophic consequences far worse than global warming.

Scientists at the Wyoming Institute of Technology, a privately-owned think tank located in Cheyenne, Wyoming, discovered that energy radiated from the sun isn’t merely captured in solar panels, but that energy is directly physically drawn from the sun by those panels, in a process they refer to as “forced photovoltaic drainage.”

“Put into laymen’s terms, the solar panels capture the sun’s energy, but pull on the sun over time, forcing more energy to be released than the sun is actually producing,” WIT claims in a scientific white paper published on Wednesday. “Imagine a waterfall, dumping water. But you aren’t catching the water in buckets, but rather sucking it in with a vacuum cleaner. Eventually, you’re going to suck in so much water that you drain the river above that waterfall completely.”

WIT is adamant that there’s no immediate danger, however. “Currently, solar panels are an energy niche, and do not pose a serious risk to the sun. But if we converted our grids to solar energy in a big way, with panels on domestic homes and commercial businesses, and paving our parking lots with panels, we’d start seeing very serious problems over time. If every home in the world had solar panels on their roofs, global temperatures would drop by as much as thirty degrees over twenty years, and the sun could die out within three hundred to four hundred years.”

The study was commissioned in August 2011 by the Halliburton corporation, who wanted to learn if the energy giant should start manufacturing and selling solar panels domestically and internationally. Halliburton’s executives wanted to know more about the sustainability of solar energy and how photovoltaic technology might evolve over the next ten years. But based on the findings of WIT’s research in the field, Halliburton revealed on Friday that they will not be entering the solar energy market.

“Solar panels destroying the sun could potentially be the worst man-made climate disaster in the history of the world, and Halliburton will not be taking part in that,” the company stated in a press release issued Friday morning. “It’s obvious, based on the findings of this neutral scientific research group, that humans needs to become more dependent on fossil fuels like oil and coal, not less. Because these so-called `green technologies’ are far more dangerous to the Earth than any hydrofracking operation or deep-water drilling station. What good is clean air when our very sun is no longer functional?”

First responders arrived on the scene at approximately 4:45 a.m. Sunday, August 23, and were preparing to enter the residence when a shirtless man brandishing what fire fighters believed to be a machete –later identified as a spatula– burst from the home. Fearing for their lives, fire fighters reacted quickly, blasting the suspect in the face at near point-blank range with a high-pressure water hose, killing him almost instantly.

Portland fire chief Sarah Bloom hailed the fire fighters as heroes during an early morning press conference on Thursday, telling reporters, “They did what they were trained to do which is to put out fires.” Chief Bloom said the fire fighters involved in the fatal spraying have been placed on paid administrative leave pending an investigation and are undergoing counseling for PTSD.

Neighbors described the man as a loner who mostly stayed indoors and was often seen wearing a surgical-style mask. “He wasn’t Black but he wasn’t entirely white either,” neighbor Shirley Moore told FOX 12 Oregon. Ms. Moore later speculated that the suspect “might be Italian or Native American” but that it was “hard to tell these days.”

While authorities have declined to disclose the suspect’s identity citing a pending investigation, a law enforcement official with firsthand knowledge of the situation told Real News Right Now that the man “was no Good Samaritan” and, in fact, had “dozens” of unpaid parking tickets and had even been issued a written citation for jaywalking in March of 2009.",Oregon Fire Dept in Hot Water After First Responders Kill Unarmed Man with Hose,fake

Trump has ordered the Department of Justice to look into the legality of postponing or all-together cancelling the 2020 presidential election in the event he is unable to lose thirty pounds by November, White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany announced on Tuesday.

“No one believes in the concept of free and fair elections more than President Trump,” McEnany told members of the White House press pool, continuing, “Having said that, the president –like all hardworking Americans– understands the importance of prioritizing personal health and establishing realistic weight-loss goals – particularly as it applies to his ability to better serve the American people.”

President Trump’s apparent decision to lose thirty pounds in the weeks and months leading up to the 2020 presidential election comes less than twenty-four hours after First Lady Melania Trump reportedly made an off-color comment regarding the president’s girth during a discussion with campaign officials which resulted in Mr. Trump abruptly storming out of the Oval Office.

“This is not the first time Melania has fat-shamed the president in front of his subordinates and it wont be the last,” a senior White House official told Real News Right Now. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the press, said the First Lady is known to “rock from side to side while making heavy stomping sounds” under her breath whenever Mr. Trump enters a room.

President Trump, who enjoys upwards of twelve Diet Cokes a day, has made no secret of his eating habits since assuming office on January 20, 2017. “If I can, I’ll avoid breakfast. In terms of that, I will have lunch but my big thing is dinner,” he told Fox News in 2016, adding that a typical meal consists of four Quarter Pounders –or two Double-Quarter Pounders– with cheese, a mountain of french fries, and five or six cans of room temperature Diet Coke.",Aides Say Trump May Call Off Election If He Can’t Lose 30 Pounds By November,fake

While Mr. Wiley declined to elaborate on the moat’s “enhanced” security features, the spokesperson issued a stark warning to potential gate-crashers and hostile intruders such as protesters and other left-wing extremists: “Once you’re in, you’re in. There is no rescue. There is no getting out.”

However, a product description supplied by the moat’s designer, Greystone Resources, provided some insight into what the public can expect. “With a depth of seventeen feet and a twelve-foot-wide gap, [the] ultramodern high-security trench is lined with anti-climbing blast-resistant steel. Combined with an all-weather drainage and filtration system, the trench features a state-of-the-art self-cleaning mechanism capable of deploying a decoagulant spray (or other chemical agent) at a rate of 40 gallons per minute.”

In a separate press release posted to its website, the National Park Service, which is responsible for maintaining the area around the White House and is overseeing the construction project, said that while the moat is “designed to mitigate current and future security threats, the president has made clear that its primary function is to provide citizens and tourists alike with an unobstructed view of the picturesque White House facade.”",Secret Service Begins Construction of ‘Security Moat’ Along White House Perimeter,fake

“It’s really quite fascinating when you look at what they’ve managed to do,” Dr. Daniel Pemberton, who heads the Primate Behavior and Ecology Program at the Imperial College of London, told Sky News. Dr. Pemberton described an “elaborate communications network” strategically positioned throughout the apes’ dense jungle habitat. “Day and night, these magnificent creatures are careening about, going this way and that, advancing rapidly into the modern age.”

Dr. Pemberton and his team have been studying the primates since mid-March when they were involuntarily quarantined at a United Nations Peacekeeping facility not far from the Congolese River. Since then, the team has embarked on “day trips” into the rain forest where they are able to observe the apes from a safe distance.

Andrew Blakeley, Dr. Pemberton’s research assistant and a visiting fellow at the Imperial College of London, spends up to seventy-two hours a week holed up in a hollowed out tree some twenty meters from the habitat. With the help of night vision equipment and a directional microphone, Mr. Blakeley is able to observe the apes in a more intimate manner.

“What we’re witnessing is nothing short sheer brilliance,” the primatologist told Real News Right Now. Later referring to the primitive communications network as a “series of low hanging vines,” Mr. Blakeley surmised that ape-human relations could soon reach previously unthinkable levels. “We may very well be witnessing the emergence of a rival species,” he said, adding, “This could be the most significant scientific breakthrough since the invention of the wheel.”",Scientists Say a Tribe of Apes in West Africa Are Close to Developing Their Own Internet,fake

The decision by the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops to portray Jesus as a brown-skinned Middle Eastern man clad in sandals and an off-white tunic comes on the heels of nationwide movement led by the American Leadership Council of Progressive Christian Womyn to eradicate perceptions of white privilege from the Christian faith.

“For far too long we have been taught that whiteness is a prerequisite for holiness,” the group’s co-founder, Kathryn Lockhart, told Real News Right Now. While adamant that she was in no way discrediting the teachings and philosophy of Jesus of Nazareth, Ms. Lockhart argued that Christ “only became the Son of God by inheriting daddy’s power.”

Robert Langdon, a professor of Art History and Symbology at Harvard University called the decision by the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops “a little silly,” but acknowledged that white privilege likely played a prominent role in the establishment of Christianity as a global religion. “When you have a situation where a white man living in the Middle East in 27 A.D. spontaneously launches a successful two-thousand-year-old religion, it raises a lot of questions.”

With thousands of souls put to death under Pontius Pilate, experts say it stands to reason that Jesus Christ – the only Caucasian man in all of Palestine who was not a Roman citizen – received special treatment and favors which, unlike countless other condemned Palestinian men and women, allowed him to miraculously rise from the dead and helped facilitate his speedy ascension into heaven.",Catholic Church to Alter Image of Jesus Over Allegations of White Privilege,fake

Commissioned in 2011 by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the eleven-foot-tall marble statue memorializes the moment the four hijackers –three Saudis and one Lebanese national– passed through security at Newark International Airport before boarding the ill-fated United Airlines Flight 93 bound for San Francisco.

Christopher Platts, the memorial’s curator, told NBC 10 Philadelphia that while some may find the statue repugnant, most visitors have expressed a deep recognition of its historical significance. “You don’t have to be an al-Qaeda sympathizer to recognize the importance of preserving this critical moment in our nation’s history,” the forty-nine year-old former high school basketball coach told NBC 10.

Fox News host Laura Ingraham weighed in on the memorial’s desecration Monday night, comparing the unidentified suspects to Islamic extremists. “Think about ISIS, what they did, they pillaged and they wiped away irreplaceable historical and religious monuments,” Mrs. Ingraham told her audience. “This happened, okay? 9/11 happened, and we owe it to the future to leave history as it existed undisturbed, continue to debate it, [and] have conversations about it.”

In a letter released by the White House on Tuesday, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman expressed his “deepest sympathies” for the loss of the multi-million dollar sculpture, calling its desecration a “national tragedy.” The Saudi prince has vowed to replace the sculpture with a larger, more structurally sound monument in time for President Trump’s second term in January 2021.",Police: Vandals Responsible for Desecration of Statue Memorializing 4 of the 19 Hijackers,fake

“Current trends show Millennials are on track to inhale upwards of twenty-five tons of oxygen per year -more than twice the global average,” explained Dr. Ross E. Geller, the study’s chief researcher. Geller, who holds a PhD in paleontology from Columbia University, warned that oxygen consumption in the United States alone has risen by more than 700% since February.

Due to social distancing guidelines and stay-at-home orders, Millennials -often referred to as the Privileged Generation- are leaving their apartments in droves, gallivanting through otherwise deserted streets and neighborhoods, and assembling in parks and other public spaces for the purpose of exercising, socializing, and other “extracurricular” activities such as vaping and dog walking.

“Our planet only produces so much oxygen per year,” said Dr. Gordon Freeman, an MIT alumni and researcher who holds a PhD in theoretical physics. “Millennials nowadays have so much free time on their hands due to COVID-“19, and, as we’re seeing, the vast majority of the ‘elitist generation’ insist on being outdoors where they’re sucking up sixty to seventy percent of the world’s oxygen supply.”

As scientists race to find a solution to the Millennial question, experts say older generations may soon find themselves short on oxygen. “Those in the greater and greatest generations could be inhaling close to 100% carbon dioxide by the end of the year,” Dr. Geller predicted. However, younger generations such as Z and Alpha are known to have much smaller lungs than full grown adults and therefore require very little, if any, oxygen to survive.",Experts Say Millennials Are Inhaling Too Much Oxygen,fake

However, in his midday address at the Apostolic Palace, the pope suggested the need for collaboration among the EU’s member states may not be as pressing a matter as he let on during his homily just hours before. Instead, Pope Francis spoke of a “strong possibility” that life as we know it ended “in the blink of an eye” some time in late November of 2019.

The Holy See Press Office was quick to defend the pope’s controversial statements on the Fifth Sunday of Easter, with spokesperson Matteo Bruni telling reporters that Vatican officials have been working closely with NASA, the World Health Organization, and [REDACTED] to determine exactly what led to last year’s extinction of all life on earth. “The working theory is a large asteroid roughly four times the size of the sun obliterated the planet,” Mr. Bruni explained before adding, “It’s entirely possible that it happened and we didn’t know.”

While the Vatican has stopped short of admitting that our new reality is in fact Hell, Pope Francis concluded his midday address on Sunday by asking Christians around the world to “consider the timely emergence of the 5G network and the murder wasp” amidst the backdrop of a global health crisis, and recalled that “the bible does not explicitly state that God’s gift of eternal life is good.”

Still, Vatican officials expressed confidence in the ongoing operation to determine the precise source of Earth’s abrupt demise. “We’ll get to the bottom of this,” a senior Vatican official who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the press told Real News Right Now. “We have sources in high places,” the official revealed, quickly backtracking. “At least we did.

Trump’s acting director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services on Thursday blasted ancient Egypt and the now-defunct Roman Empire, saying Joseph, Mary, and the infant Jesus should never have been granted entry into the Roman province because they lacked proper documentation at the time.

“Absolutely, they should not have been allowed in,” acting director Ken Cuccinelli argued during a heated exchange with reporters. “Gaius Petronius should have enacted stricter immigration laws and, frankly, he should have done more to enforce existing laws,” Cuccinelli said, referring to the Roman Empire’s prefect in Egypt around 4 BCE. “Had he done so, I guarantee you the region would not be in the state it is today; we would have a peaceful and prosperous Middle East.”

According to biblical accounts, Joseph fled to Egypt with Mary and baby Jesus after an angel warned him that King Herod planned to kill his child. In fact, King Herod –the Roman Empire’s prefect of Judea– had ordered the execution of all male children under the age of two in what historians refer to as the Massacre of the Innocents. Drawing parallels to modern times, Mr. Cuccinelli charged that if Joseph and Mary weren’t happy with events in Judea, they should “find a way to change them rather than take the cowardly way out by abandoning their countrymen.”

Mr. Cuccinelli went on to question whether Joseph and Mary were fit to be parents in the first place, citing their decision to trek nearly a thousand miles through the desert on foot with a newborn baby. “It’s absolutely abhorrent to think of any parent putting their child –particularly the Son of God– through that kind of ordeal,” he said, adding, “The moral thing to do would have been to take the legal route to Egyptian citizenship and get in line like everyone else.”

According to historical documents on display at the Museum of Egyptian Antiquities in Cairo, Egyptians around 4 BCE were extremely displeased with the influx of refugees from Judea and elsewhere, whom they believed had come to steal pyramid building jobs from hardworking Egyptians, while at the same time exploiting the welfare of the Roman Empire.","Acting Immigration Chief Slams Ancient Egypt for Allowing Jesus, Mary to Enter Illegally",fake

Authorities say Travis Pratt, a former high school track star and popular fly fishing guide, was last seen around 11:30 a.m. on July 9th at The Base Camp, a sporting goods store in downtown Billings. “He was here for about fifteen minutes, dropped off some business cards and bought a backpacking stove,” Willy Ferguson, an employee at The Base Camp, told KULR-8, a local NBC affiliate. “He said he was headed up to Two Moon for the day,” Ferguson recalled, adding, “There was nothing out of the ordinary about it.”

Pratt is the fifth person to be abducted from Two Moons Park since 2017 and authorities believe he won’t be the last. “We’re seeing a disturbing trend here,” Billings Police Chief Rich St. John said during a press briefing on Tuesday. “In each case, the victim has simply vanished without a trace.” St. John noted that all five abductees have been men between the ages of thirty-five and forty. A sixth individual, Kenneth Sabelli, who was abducted from the park in May of 2018, managed to escape captivity nearly three months later by boarding an escape pod and returning to earth.

The escape pod, which police described as being “about the size of a minivan,” is currently being housed in a secure garage at the Billings Police Department impound lot and has incurred nearly $14,000 in daily storage fees. The department ramped up security at the lot late last year following “multiple attempts by unknown entities” to retrieve the extraterrestrial craft. “Additional officers and resources have been assigned to the area and residents have been advised to maintain a safe distance from the facility,” a statement posted to the department’s website read.

While authorities have refused to comment on what, if anything, was recovered from the escape pod, locals believe a type of advanced weaponry is currently being employed by the department’s SWAT team. “I don’t know, some kind of anti-matter weapon, maybe?” Joshua Hackworth, a West End resident who witnessed a pre-dawn drug raid while walking his German Shepherd last October, told the Billlings Gazette. “All I know is I heard a noise that sounded like a jet engine.

The current bill, which features former president Andrew Jackson, was initially scheduled for replacement by 2020, with former slave and abolitionist Harriet Tubman taking Jackson’s place. However, those plans, according to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, have since been scrapped. “Projected production costs were simply too high,” Secretary Mnuchin told reporters, adding, “Frankly speaking, a likeness of Mrs. Tubman would require too much ink.”

Described as a “symbol of American prosperity and self-determination,” the newly revised twenty-dollar note will feature a “stylized rendition” of President Donald J. Trump’s likeness as it appears in his official White House portrait. On the backside, the White House –which made its currency debut in 1928– will be forced into early retirement as a new portrait depicting American soybean farmers toiling in the fields against the backdrop of a border wall with a bald eagle and two F-35 Joint Strike Fighters flying overhead takes its place.

The inclusion of American soybean farmers came at the insistence of President Trump, who is said to have “taken it upon himself to oversee every step” of the design process. “The American soybean farmer is very near and dear to the president’s heart,” White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham told Fox News on Wednesday, adding that Mr. Trump believes the updated twenty-dollar bill will serve as a “lasting tribute to the American soybean farmer’s many contributions to the stability and longevity of our nation’s economy.”

According to a statement released by the Bureau of Engraving and Printing –the federal agency responsible for the production of U.S. currency– the revised twenty-dollar bill is scheduled to begin production in early August and is expected to enter circulation by the end of the year.","Treasury Secretary: Updated Twenty-Dollar Bill to Feature Soybean Farmers, Border Wall",fake

“It has come to our attention that detainees housed at some of our migrant detention facilities are unhappy with the standards of living provided to them at the expense of American taxpayers,” DHS spokesperson Oscar Durlwanger announced during a Tuesday morning press briefing at the agency’s headquarters in Washington, D.C. “Unfortunately, operational protocols for these facilities were established during the Obama-era and therefore cannot be undone,” Mr. Durlwanger explained. “When it comes to improving detainees’ quality of life and standards of living, suffice to say our hands are tied.”

While the Department of Homeland Security and the Trump administration as a whole remain powerless to overturn an Obama-era directive to detain and separate migrant children from their families, DHS officials believe they have found a final solution to the ongoing sanitation problem. “In the coming weeks, state-of-the-art industrial incinerators will be installed at all border-state CBP-run detention centers in an effort to facilitate the speedy disposal of soiled garments such as clothing and other textiles,” Spokesperson Durlwanger said before adding that due, in part, to budgetary constraints, “trusted” detainees –some as young as eleven– will be tasked with operating the incinerators.

“As Americans, we are privileged in that we expect a very high standard of living,” stressed one CBP official who oversees intake at a migrant detention center in Clint, Texas. “To say these facilities are somehow substandard is deliberately misleading. This is not a five-star resort; it’s a holding center for unaccompanied minors who made a conscious decision to alienate their families and flee their country of origin in order to enter the United States illegally and suckle from the teat of the American taxpayer.”

U.S. Customs and Border Protection and its parent agency, the Department of Homeland Security, have come under increasing scrutiny amid claims that migrant children are being subjected to “extreme[ly] cold temperatures, lights on 24 hours a day, [and] no adequate access to medical care, basic sanitation, water, or adequate food.” DHS officials on Tuesday vehemently dismissed such allegations, saying the decision to install industrial incinerators was largely due to mounting complaints from locals about a “foul odor” emanating from the camps.",DHS to Install Incinerators At Detention Camps to Deal with Influx of Soiled Garments,fake

Graham reiterated his claim that he bought the 6’3 silicone statue to serve as a daily reminder of his ‘unyielding devotion’ to President Trump. “Where I come from it’s not uncommon for folks to show respect for their Commander-in-Chief,” Graham later told Sean Hannity during an appearance on Fox News.

However, a spokesperson for the Shenzhen Jarliet Company, a mainland China-based mass-producer and exporter of adult-themed products, described Mr. Graham’s statue as a “doll,” saying the South Carolina senator’s $11,000 custom order was nothing out of the ordinary. “We have a very diverse customer base,” the spokesperson told Real News Right Now, adding that the United States accounts for more than thirty percent of the company’s annual sales.

The aide added that he attended the party as a “plus-one” and did not know Senator Graham personally.

Trump signed an executive order on Tuesday directing the Department of Justice to revoke all sixteen Thanksgiving Day turkey pardons issued by the former president during his eight years in office.

“After reviewing the decisions made by the previous administration, President Trump has determined that a number of turkey pardons issued by Barack Obama were done so in a manner that was both deceitful and hazardous to the American people,” White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer announced on Tuesday. “This morning, the president once again used his executive powers to see to it that justice is served and that the surviving creatures will be destroyed.”

Spicer said very little is known about the true origins of the sixteen turkeys or why they were specifically singled out by former President Barack Obama. “There are a lot of obvious questions we just don’t have the answers to. Were they connected to radical Islamic terrorism? Black Lives Matter extremists? We can’t be sure,” he said. “All we know is they were sentenced to death and Obama took it upon himself to meddle in the independent judicial process.”

Of the sixteen turkeys pardoned by Obama, all but five are deceased. “These birds, despite their deaths, will have their pardons revoked posthumously during a ceremony in the Rose Garden,” Secretary Spicer explained. The remaining birds – Tater, Tot, Abe, Honest, and Cheese – are scheduled to be remanded into federal custody on Friday before they are turned over to officials from the Federal Bureau of Prisons who are under orders to execute the turkeys by firing squad.

The decision comes on the heels of a four-day sit-in organized by PDX Furs, a regional furry community based in the Portland metro area, which staged the protest at Portland’s city council offices on Milwaukie Avenue last weekend. “This is a huge victory,” said Bo Kirkman. “Not just for furries here in Portland but furries living all across the United States.”

Bo, a former kindergarten teacher and self-described furry rights advocate, told the Portland Tribune that he identifies as a dog. “It’s one thing to say you can’t bring your cat or your ferret or whatever to the off-leash areas because obviously they’re not dogs. But if I want to go to the park and play with my owner, well as a canine, that should be my right.”

Now, thanks to the City of Portland, Bo and his fellow furries can take advantage of the city’s designated off-leash areas. “Provided they respect and adhere to the posted rules and regulations at our city parks,” said Public Affairs commissioner Dan Saltzman who sits on the city council and voted in favor of the resolution.

According to the City of Portland’s official website, dog park visitors are expected to pick up and dispose of their pet’s waste and are advised to leave sick animals at home. “In an effort to prevent the spread of disease, we ask that owners refrain from allowing their dogs – or furries – drink from standing water,” Saltzman said.

However, not everyone is celebrating the new resolution.. “I think it’s rediculous,” said council-member Amanda Fritz who sits on the Portland Parks Board and voted against the proposal. “We’re allowing people in costumes to frolic about and fornicate to their heart’s content in our public parks.”

Mrs. Fritz may be alone in her sentiments.

“It’s a very fine place,” Mr. Sessions declared during a Washington-area breakfast event hosted by House Speaker Paul Ryan. “There’s plenty of space. They are well equipped – perhaps more so than we are – to handle these kinds of criminals.” Attorney General Sessions explained that under his proposed plan, the military would continue to oversee all operational aspects of the prison, including interrogation. “But,” he added, “I see no legal problem whatsoever with doing that.”

Citing a classified Bush-era intelligence report stating that at least five hijackers were high on marijuana when they carried out terror attacks in New York and Washington on September 11, 2001, Mr. Sessions likened the rise of marijuana acceptance in the United States to the spread of the Islamic State. “Dope dealers peddling their poison on our streets are no different than the Islamic extremists who seek to destroy our way of life,” he said.

While Sessions allowed that drug dealers are “slightly less awful” than terrorists, he said they share similar values and goals. “Right now we have a handful of states where people are willing to defy federal law in order to establish some kind of pot caliphate,” Sessions charged. The attorney general went on to describe states such as Colorado and Oregon, where recreational marijuana is legal, as “lawless regions” all but devoid of American values. “You have people there – elected officials even – who view our Constitution as just another piece of paper which they can roll into a marijuana cigarette.”

Speaking at Luke Air Force Base near Phoenix, Arizona, last month, Attorney General Sessions expressed surprise and dismay over the fact that most Americans don’t share his views on marijuana. “When you consider that more than fifty percent of the country supports efforts to legalize it, you have to wonder who these people are,” Sessions said, adding, “Good people don’t smoke marijuana and I’m inclined to believe the majority of Americans are good people.”",AG Sessions Tells Congress He's Considering using GTMO to House Drug Offenders,fake

The controlled blaze was part of a concentrated effort by the Armed Forces of Bolivia to eradicate a rare species of spider that officials say is responsible for more than six hundred deaths over the last four months, with eighty-three occurring in November alone. Known as the acecho – or stalking – spider, the astoundingly elusive arachnid can grow to about the size of a small dog. With fangs sharp enough to pierce body armor, the acecho is capable of killing a full-grown adult within seconds of inflicting its venomous bite.

Bolivian officials blame increasingly warmer climates for the sharp rise in acecho spider attacks. “This species is most prevalent in areas known for moderate to frequent volcanic activity,” said Jack Robinson, an Australian-born rainforest biologist and canopy researcher. Robinson and his team were hired by the Bolivian Ministry of National Defense to investigate the dangerous arachnids after seventeen Bolivian soldiers were found dead in their bunks – all having sustained puncture wounds to their upper body and torso region. “Despite their size, these are highly versatile creatures,” explained Robinson. “I have personally observed an acecho spider traverse the forest floor at speeds up to forty-eight kilometers per hour.”

In October, Bolivia’s state-funded newspaper Cambio reported that the country’s armed forces were trying unsuccessfully to squash out the spider population before it could spread to more heavily populated cities and towns. “This is our biggest fear,” Defense Minister Soto was quoted as saying. “Our commanders are receiving reports from soldiers on the ground that the use of napalm is totally ineffective and only causes the spiders to scatter.” Bolivia has since procured a “sizable” amount of white phosphorous from the United States. “Despite the odds, I remain confident the Bolivian people can overcome this crisis,” Soto said.

In addition to providing more than $53 million in military aid, U.S. President Barack Obama has authorized the deployment of up to 240 special operations troops to assist the Bolivian government in combating the arachnid threat.",Bolivian Army Razes 300 Acres of Rainforest as Spider Deaths Soar,fake
61,http://realnewsrightnow.com/2017/06/scientists-warn-pink-cows-verge-extinction/,2017-06-25T23:09:06+00:00,Realnewsrightnow,"VERMON, Vt. – The world’s pink cow population could become extinct as early as 2028 and humans are unsurprisingly to blame, according to a new study conducted by the Innovation Center for U.S. Dairy.

A close cousin of the brown cow, pink cows were first discovered in the 1950’s during the rise of nuclear power. “Pink cows are essentially a byproduct of nuclear energy,” explained Dr. Emmett Brown, the study’s lead researcher. “As nuclear power plants began to pop up in rural areas, you had a sizable population of brown dairy cows that, as a result of prolonged exposure to moderate levels of radiation, mutated into pink cows.”

Unlike brown cows which produce chocolate milk, pink cows are known for producing strawberry milk, a refreshing dairy drink which has enjoyed increasing popularity since its inception in the late fifties. “Strawberry milk consumption is the number one driving force behind the coming extinction of the pink cow population,” charged Dr. Brown, who explained that due to the presence of radiation, the process of extracting strawberry milk from pink cows is typically conducted in a highly controlled environment where the risk of radiation exposure is reduced to a minimum.

Scientists say prolonged exposure to radiation, coupled with rigorous milk extraction methods, has reduced the average lifespan of the pink dairy cow to just under three years. “Whereas brown cows will, on average, produce upwards of three hundred fifty-thousand glasses of chocolate milk in their lifetime, pink cows typically produce less than half that amount,” explained Hershel Greene, a dairy farmer in southern Vermont who was one of the first U.S. farmers to capitalize on the strawberry milk industry.

A strong proponent of nuclear power, Greene told Real News Right Now he began selling strawberry milk to Nestlé in 1975 – two years after the nearby Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Plant became operational. However, since the plant’s closure in December of 2014, Greene said business has taken a hit. “We’re seeing fewer and fewer pink cow births every year,” he said. The solution, according to Greene, is a global proliferation of nuclear power plants. “We as a society need to embrace the benefits of nuclear energy. It is, after all, safer and far more efficient than the alternative,” argued Green. “Otherwise, strawberry milk production as we know it will no longer be sustainable.”",Scientists Warn Pink Cows on the Verge of Extinction,fake

“The president has asked me to appoint a competent nonpartisan prosecutor to spearhead the investigation,” Attorney General Barr explained. Mr. Barr went on to say that due to “the desolate state” of the DOJ, he saw no other option but to appoint himself as special counsel for the birth certificate investigation. “I cannot, in good faith, trust anyone other than myself to lead an investigation of this magnitude,” the attorney general concluded.

While Mr. Barr declined to elaborate on the nature of the investigation, he said Justice Department lawyers are preparing subpoenas for a number of individuals believed to be associated with the birth of Barack Hussein Obama on August 4, 1961. “In the coming weeks we will issue subpoenas for those individuals charged with record keeping at the Honolulu hospital where Mr. Obama was allegedly born,” the attorney general stated, adding that the doctors who “allegedly delivered” the infant Obama -or their next of kin- will also be called to testify.

In an official statement released Wednesday, former CIA director and acting Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the Department of State is lending “limited support” to Mr. Barr’s investigation. “We at the State Department are working closely with our counterparts in the Kenyan government to locate a witch doctor who is suspected of masterminding the plot to conceal Barack Obama’s national origin,” the statement read.

“This is about seeking absolute confirmation that Barack Obama was actually eligible to hold office from 2008 until 2016,” a senior White House official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the press, told The Washington Times. “In the end we’re looking at the immediate removal of all Obama-era appointees including federal judges and Supreme Court Justices; not to mention a full reversal of any Obama policies and pardons that President Trump may have missed or overlooked,” the official told The Times.

Although both the Obama White House and the state of Hawaii have produced copies of Mr. Obama’s long-form birth certificate, President Donald J. Trump believes both to be forgeries and has long called for an investigation into their legitimacy. “They’ve got an entire black market for fake birth certificates,” then-candidate Trump told Fox News host Chris Wallace in 2015, adding, “It’s a terrible thing what they’re doing on that island.”

The Department of Justice investigation into the validity of Barack Obama’s birth certificate -along with his status as an American citizen- is expected to last at least two and a half years and will cost U.S. taxpayers upwards of $250 million.",Barr Appoints Special Counsel to Determine Validity of Obama’s Birth Certificate,fake

“I’ve just been saying these sarcastic things all this time to see what would happen,” Trump told reporters from the Oval Office.

“So everything you’ve ever said has been sarcastic?” one reported for The Hill asked the President.

“Yes. The things I’ve said, the things I’ve done, every single action I’ve taken during my entire presidency, basically the past 6 years of my life, it’s all been just one big sarcastic joke. Get it?”

“You guys didn’t actually believe any of that stuff, did you?” he added.

After a brief moment of silence from the press corps, one female journalist eventually responded: “So when you said that you used to walk into women’s locker rooms at the Miss America contests and grab other women by their pussies, you mean to say that you were being sarcastic?”

“Yes of course, young lady. I would never, ever abuse my position of power by taking advantage of women like that. I was being sarcastic. Get it? Furthermore I would never ever be unfaithful to my wife.”

“What about when you claimed to have had the largest attendance at an inaugration in history. Was that sarcastic?” another reporter queried.

“Absolutely! Didn’t you see the pictures!” the President responded.

“So when you called Mexicans rapists, that was sarcasm too?”

“Yes. Totally sarcastic.”

“And when you said you were going to build a wall with Mexico?”

“Of course! You guys didn’t actually follow through on that, did you?” he said, turning to his bemused staff. “That was a total joke each and every one of the 14,836 times I said it. I mean doesn’t anyone get sarcasm around here?!”

“You should have seen the looks on your faces when I told you I wanted to buy Greenland,” he exclaimed, shaking his head in disbelief. “I can’t believe you actually bought that shit.”

“What about when you called Rosie O’Donnell a fat pig, a slob, a…..”

“OK, that was the only time when I was not being sarcastic,” Trump interrupted. “I meant every single word I said about Rosie.”

“And when you said you would be dating Ivanka if she wasn’t your daughter?”

“OK this meeting is over,” Trump said, ending the press conference, before ordering everyone except Ivanka to leave the room immediately.

“Hillary Clinton is patient zero of the Coronavirus,” President Trump announced in a press conference Friday night flanked by Mike Pence and senior members of the Trump administration. “She started all of this chaos just to derail my re-election campaign.”

Clinton, who has yet to display any symptoms of the coronavirus, was identified by Trump’s administration who believes his 2016 presidential rival is the cause of the worldwide virus that has killed thousands so far.

“You can tell she started all this. Just look at her. She looks infected doesn’t she?” Trump declared. “You see? This is why I wanted her locked up. She’s a health risk to not just this country but the entire world.”

A special White House task force, fronted by Vice President Pence made the discovery after analysing DNA samples of both the Coronavirus and Ms. Clinton and finding what they claim is a “99% DNA match” between the two.

“The evidence is undeniable,” Pence told the assembled media. “Ms. Clinton and the Coronavirus are one in the same. Clinton will now be placed in quarantine until 2021 along with any Democratic canditates she has been in contact with, Pence added.

When asked by a reporter how they could be so sure Clinton started the Coronavirus, Trump interrupted. “Listen, no one knows more about the Coronavirus than me… except possibly Hillary or ‘Killary’ as I will now be calling her.”

Furthermore in a move that is sure to please makers of Corona beer, Trump proposed renaming the deadly virus after Hillary in future. “The Clintonvirus has such a nice ring to it, don’t you think?” he grinned.

The change was spotted by users on Twitter who noticed that the Taiwanese government’s foreign studies webpage now lists the University of British Columbia as “UBC, British Columbia (Province of China)”.

Earlier this week UBC listed Taiwan as a province of China and blamed their recent adoption of new ISO data standards as the cause. According to a leading Taiwanese government official this change also caused a computer glitch on their servers too leading to the unfortunate mix-up.

He denied the change was motivated by revenge stating that it was “likely just a simple computing error on UBC’s end perhaps due their overreliance on Huawei technology”.

“We only adopted the ISO standards for financial reasons, ” he added. “We’re sure UBC will understand this motivation.”

So there can be no further confusion about the issue, the Taiwanese government have sent an apology letter to the board of UBC written in Mandarin and translated into Cantonese.

This is not the only political misstep UBC has taken in recent years. In 2016 the university caused controversy when it referred to Hong Kong as “Should-Be Province of China” and again in 2019 when it referred to Alberta as a province of Canada.

Construction on the expansion was fast tracked by Metro Vancouver, with workers working long and hard over the winter months to get the project complete in an effort to fulfill Vancouverites’ insatiable appetite for torturing their bodies.

“You talked, we listened,” read a tweet from Grouse Mountain’s Twitter account. “You said you LOVED the Grouse Grind but HATED that it ended so quickly…. So we heard you and we think you’ll be pleasantly surprised with the results!”

The new trail, which begins and ends in the same locations, will now feature an additional 2,100 steps taking the grand total up to 5,000.

Most of the additional steps will be in areas that were previously flat, with steps going up and down in quick succession and several large sections of stairs going around in circles, as well as zigzagging up and down the mountain. Mini steps in between larger steps have also been added.

Competition to complete the new Grind in record time is fierce with one man alleging to have already finished it in under 30 minutes.

“It was pretty tough but the secret is to not stop moving,” Sam, 31, told reporters while being lifted into an air ambulance by paramedics. “Hopefully when my calves have been stitched back together I can break my previous best of a minute flat.”

Grouse Mountain has confirmed oxygen tanks, wheelchairs and defibrillators will be available at the summit for a fee.

420 Vancouver was originally expected to take place at Sunset beach, after organizers believed they had reached an agreement with city staff. However, the Vancouver Park Board immediately objected to this decision, insisting they had jurisdiction over any event held at a city park.

At the insistence of the Park Board, event organizers and city staff began sounding out alternative locations. Closing Burrard Bridge for the day was considered but organizers were fearful that an event there might entice Christy Clark to show up, something they deem “a nightmare scenario”.

The festival will largely centre around the busy intersection at Main and Hastings st but will stretch two blocks along East Hastings st. from Main to Carrall. VPD are warning motorists that “at least” 10 sq. blocks will be closed for the event, due to fears over secondhand smoke affecting drivers.

Last year the event attracted up to 30,000 people, which resulted in a sizable police presence outside the art gallery. This year, despite over 100,000 protesters expected to attend this year’s festivities on East Hastings, Vancouver Police say their involvment will be “scaled back considerably”. “We believe that our presence isn’t required this year and that we can allow attendees to self police. This is a philosophy that has worked in the Eastside for years, and we see no reason to change now.”

Mayor Robertson says the move “makes sense” and that the whole community can feel comfortable about the move. “Drugs belong in Vancouver’s Eastside so I think it’s a great solution for everyone.” The mayor says the event will also help boost the Eastside’s once thriving underground drug market, which has suffered in recent years due to the opening of several drug rehabilitation centre’s in the area.

Robertson even said that if the event proves successful, he would consider legalizing Marijuana, along the same two blocks of E. Hastings. “Hell I don’t even care if they stay there every day and get stoned as long as they stay in the Eastside. Eventually we could even bypass the area altogether to allow them extra space to protest.”

Meanwhile, Justin Trudeau is still expected to be the guest of honour at the event, where the Prime Minister will light a ceremonial 20ft joint at precisely 4:20pm, before taking the first toke and passing it to the left. “It’ll be great to see all the guys down on East Hastings,” he told FM News. “Since I became PM, I never get to hang out on the streets, smoking dope and selling scrap metal, but that’s the sacrifice you have to make in this job.”

In a ground-breaking speech broadcasted live across the entire nation, the Prime Minister outlined his “concerns” about certain U.S. lawmakers entering Canada.

“When America elects its politicians, they’re not electing their best,” Trudeau began, in front of a silent House of Commons.

“They’re electing politicians that have lots of problems, and they’re going to bring those problems here. They’ll bring lies. They’ll bring fear. They’re racists… And some I assume are good people,” he continued, stressing the importance of Canadian values being upheld and not influenced by recent events south of the border.

The ban, which Trudeau explained would begin initially on a trial period of approximately 2 years, would apply to all high-ranking bureaucrats of the United States. “In 2020 we can reassess and see how it’s working,” he added.

Cryptically, the PM did not mention any American “leaders” specifically at risk of exile from the Great White North, sending the rumour mill into overdrive. However, the reputable American broadcaster FOX News later exclusively revealed that Canada’s ban will be targeted at Obama and immediately called on President-elect Trump to oppose Canada’s potential action.

“This is just those Eskimos trying to stop us from shipping Obama back where he belongs,” respected journalist Sean Hannity said. “I’ve been saying it for years. We all know Obama was born in Canada, just look at his birth cert.”

However the Prime Minister denied the claims, insisting it’s “highly unlikely” the ban will ever be invoked, as any potential US politician would have to violate a number of “near-capital offences” relating to tax evasion, sexual assault and hate speech.

“They’d honestly have to be a total asshole for it ever to even happen,” he stressed.

While most passengers were justifiably horrified at the woman’s brazenly ungrateful attitude, some attempted to cover up for her on social media, claiming that maybe she is “just from out east”. However a special Vancouver Sun investigation into the incident uncovered the woman was a local, having lived in the Lower Mainland her entire life.

Now Translink has confirmed the 24-month sentence in a written letter to the woman’s attorney, who claims her client has accepted “full responsibility for her actions”, bringing to an end a 5-month investigation costing BC taxpayers $1.3 million.

“My client feels incredible shame for her inaction and fully accepts her punishment without reservation,” a statement on the woman’s behalf read. “Once again she would like to extend her deepest sympathies to the bus driver, his family, friends and anyone else she offended.”

While not technically illegal in Vancouver, not thanking a bus driver or automated skytrain is strongly frowned upon and considered the height of disrespect. Yet now that Translink has imposed its first ban, local legislators admit the “time has come” to update Vancouver’s outdated laws surrounding bus driver courtesy and give the men and women in neon vests and cycling shorts the respect they deserve in a formal setting.

In their ‘Call for Submissions’ the B.C. government stated that special consideration would be given to anyone with experience sculpting John Fluevog shoes.

Dr. Henry became world famous during the Covid-19 outbreak for her calm, measured and decisive response. B.C. now has the lowest rates of new cases as other Canadian provinces still struggle to contain the spread.

“Bonnie Henry has been featured in the NY Times as THE shining example to the entire world on how to lead during a pandemic. Gassy Jack’s major claim to fame was marrying the 12-year-old niece of his dead wife, so it’s not really a tough call.”

The new statues will feature Dr. Henry in a variety of poses including one of her revealing the Superman logo beneath her blouse and another of her in her iconic pose behind a Province of B.C. podium.

“The statues will feature Bonnie’s iconic Fluevog shoes, will be over 20 feet tall and will be made of pure solid gold,” a government spokesperson confirmed, “so as to keep them as true to Dr. Henry’s likeness as possible.”

“I’m still young and have my whole career ahead of me. David Moyes has been getting some backlash from the media. Still, I believe we can turn the season around,” Jones insisted.

The decision was announced by star player and Chief Tax Avoiding Officer at Barcelona, Lionel Messi.

“We Barcelona players cannot afford to sit idly by when our country is falling apart around us. We need more doctors, nurses and hospitals and as a result we need more tax revenue,” Messi announced on Facebook. “Because of this, we the Barcelona players, have taken the very difficult decision to start paying our taxes in full.”

Spanish tax authorities are reportedly “shocked” by the announcement with many remarking they never thought they would live to see the day that Lionel Messi voluntarily paid his tax bill. “Has the Bernabeu frozen over or has Lionel Messi just offered to pay his taxes,” responded one stunned tax executive.

Barcelona players have famously not paid a single cent in tax revenue since the mid 00’s when a young 17-year-old Argentine showed up at the Nou Camp with new ideas. “He was so incredibly determined. Leo came with this singular attitude that he would become the greatest player in the world and also never pay taxes again,” recalls club legend Xavi.

“After we won our first La Liga title with him, he gifted every single player in the squad a new accountant and an offshore holding company. ‘From now on you will never stop winning and you will never stop avoiding taxes,’ he told us. He was not wrong.”

Speaking at the House of Commons, Johnson was asked what he felt the appropriate response should be towards reigning Premier League champions.

“Well, my wholehearted congratulations and thanks to Manchester City for their heartfelt dedication to the Brexit cause and to Pep Guardiola for such a high-profile personal endorsement of myself and my leadership. It is very much acknowledged and appreciated.”

“It really sends a message that our boys won’t be pushed around by the European bigwigs any longer,” Johnson continued. “Who needs the Champions League when you have the Carabao Cup?”

“Who needs Real Madrid and Barcelona when you can have Celtic and Rangers?” he said, before glancing at the SNP ministers. “At least for a few years more anyway?”

“We shall have or own Champions League, the British Champions League, featuring Britain’s finest teams from London to Cardiff, Glasgow to somewhere in Northern Ireland.” Johnson added, before refusing to rule out pulling all remaining British teams from Europe.

Rashford has now failed to score in over 140 mins of Premier League football and indeed during his entire 270 mins as a professional footballer, he has only managed to score in 4 of those minutes.

At one point in his career, the self confessed “die-hard United fan” appeared to have the world at his feet having scored twice against Arsenal and FC Midtjylland, but he has since been brought crashing back down to reality, after failing to score against Watford. As the final whistle blew on United’s 1-0 win, while there were cheers for the United team, loud cries of “you’re just a shit Federico Macheda” were directed at Rashford from the Stretford End, as he left the pitch.

“The fans were right to boo, my performance was not good enough,” he told reporters. “I’m trying to not let the drought get to me and just trying to focus on helping the team in other ways and eventually the goals will come. I just hope this little spell doesn’t affect my England place.”

Including non-matchdays, Rashford is without a goal in over 5 days in the league and nearly 8 days in Europe, a statistic the veteran 18-year-old is well aware of.

“People say it’s the longest scoring drought in Premier League history,” he said disappointingly. “I know my record hasn’t been good enough lately but I still think I can improve. I’ve just turned 18, I’m still at least a year or 2 from my peak. I just hope the fans haven’t given up on me.”

Having suffered the embarrassment of not scoring in 45 minutes of football against Watford, Rashford was moved out to the right-wing for the second half. Given the Mancunian’s current scoring run, it’s a position he feels he could develop into: “Yeah it’s a possibility, I’m obviously not much of a finisher so maybe I could play out wide, or right back, or even centre back. I’m willing to reinvent myself to save my career, like my idol, Alan Smith.”

When Rashford first burst onto the scene last Thursday, scoring twice on his senior debut, the forward appeared to have it all. He followed that up with another brace against Arsenal that led to many to claim he could be the next big England star. Following that win, Louis Van Gaal warned the young striker against the trappings of fame. “He must keep his feet on the ground and not get swept up by all the publicity,” Van Gaal said. “Yes of course if he continues to score goals like this, he will become the greatest player to ever play the game, but he must not get carried away.”

However, last Sunday feels like a lifetime ago. Given the 18-year-old’s current disappointing run in front of goal, Van Gaal admits he may look to bring in some players from the youth setup. “I may rest Marcus for a few games and give some young players a chance for once. Nicky Butt tells me we have a number of options in our Under-14 squad to choose from.”

The Man Utd manager admits he will “wait until the summer” before making a decision on Rashford’s future, but widespread speculation suggests the no. 39 will leave Old Trafford, possibly for the MLS. Van Gaal says it would be a “sad end” to a career that began so brightly. “I remember how promising he looked in the beginning,” Van Gaal said. “He had a great eye for goal back then, but that was 7 days ago, and now Marcus’ career is in real danger of stalling permanently.”

Roy Hodgson appeared equally as frustrated with the former goalscorer, as he watched on from the stands. The England manager later admitted that Rashford was now “unlikely” to make the squad for Euro 2016 unless he can “somehow rediscover his scoring touch”. “Four goals in three games is not the type of form we expect from an England international,” Hodgson said.

LIVERPOOL, UK—Wayne Rooney has issued a staunch defence of his latest drink-driving charge, calling on his critics to “try being in Liverpool sober” if they think it’s so easy.

At a press conference Monday morning, the former Manchester United star told the assembled media that spending time in the city of Liverpool isn’t all it’s cracked up to be once you sober up.

“Honestly you lot [the media] have no idea what it’s like,” Rooney declared.

“With a clear head there’s nowt to do here. It rains all the time and the shopping centre is fucking tiny. Literally all there is to do is drive down to the pub for a few pitchers.”

Despite England’s record goalscorer still living predominantly in Manchester, Rooney claims even spending 8-10 hours a day in Liverpool is enough to drive him to drink:

“Plus I dunno if you’ve noticed, but when you’re not smashed off your face Everton are actually quite a bit shitter than Man United. So there’s that too,” he added.

“Honestly if I’m gonna somehow survive the next 9 months here I dunno what I’ll have to do… Probably weed.”

The 29-year-old caused controversy last month by signing for the mega-rich—but largely unknown—Manchester United, and now Sanchez has decided as a show of good will to help out his cash-strapped former employers.

“Times are pretty tough at Arsenal right now. Ever since they moved into that new 60,000 seater stadium the club has barely made over £420m a season,” Sanchez told ArsenalFanTv. “Hopefully this can help in some small way.”

Sanchez, who according to British tabloids must be one of the 100 richest people alive, will donate one tenth of his wages which could earn his former side up £30,000 per week.

“It will help keep the lights on for another year I suppose,” Martin Keown told the BBC, “but he’s still one of the worst human beings to have ever lived. Right up there with Hitler.”

Not all reaction to the news has been positive however. Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola used today’s press conference to complain that Sanchez had not offered any compensation to his club despite pinkie promising to sign for the Citizens.

The move comes after the company’s co-founder Nick Rabuchin sent a series of racist and derogatory comments to Black and Jewish women, prompting him to apologize for getting caught before resigning in an Instagram post titled “I FUCKED UP”.

Having being dropped by many major retailers such as Indigo and Nordstrom, the company also announced its intention to relocate to nearby Kamloops and start again under a new name.

“We wanted the new name to reflect our fresh start but with also a nod and a wink to our past and we feel that the ‘Kamloops Kandle Kompany’ reflects that. Because no one should ever forget where we came from.”

In disgust at the changes Mr. Rabuchin resigned Wednesday morning bemoaning the rise of “PC culture” that he claims is the real reason for the backlash against the candle company.

“Gone are the days when you could anonymously text black people and call them the n-word,” Rabuchin told the Daily Stormer. “It’s PC culture gone mad.”

The formerly known Vancouver Candle Co. confirmed Mr. Rabuchin’s departure, claiming he will have no further connection to a company he still owns with his life partner, other than to collect his share of the company’s dwindling profits.

Furthermore the company took to Instagram again, posted the image “WE FUCKED UP AGAIN” followed by an announcement that the company would be recalling all 40 of its ‘Scents of Auschwitz’ and instead focus on increasing their ever popular range of tiki torches.

The new 44,000 sq. ft. store at 1641 Davie St comes complete with an extravagant light display comprising of over 1 billion green LED lights that illuminates the entire street as well as approximately 15 square blocks.

At 3:52 AM PST on Thursday morning astronauts aboard the International Space Station reported seeing a “piercing green light” emanating from the Pacific Northwest. Upon closer inspection NASA were able to determine the light was in fact coming from the new Safeway (49°28’57″90°N, 123°13’89″10°E), becoming only the second human made creation to be visible from outside the earth’s atmosphere.

At the official unveiling, which blinded 37 people, Safeway CEO Michael Murphy stated that “this is a proud day for not only Safeway but for the entire Davie Village Community! This is as much for all of you as it is for us.”

Other neighbours who have yet to lose their vision, say an unexpected benefit of the revamped store is that most will never need to use lighting in their apartments anymore, saving a fortune on electricity bills.

However, some local residents have complained, prompting Safeway to respond by releasing a 72-point action plan for the local community on how best to operate on 15 minutes sleep per night and also how to counter the effects of mild to severe radiation poisoning.

Supporters of the Confederate battle flag argue that their support is driven by pride in the South, not negative racial attitudes. A symbol of a Southern heritage predicated on heroism and sacrifice.

White Nationalists demand replacement of US flag

“This is what America was built on and we are not giving up!” said Bill Buckley, White Nationalist leader for the Alabama division. “This flag represents our white pride, our ability to build a country, organize a people while being supreme leaders. No other race has accomplished what we have because we are intelligently superior.”

“For example, we were able to conquer this country because of our strength and perseverance. Because of us, you have the structures that allow you to live with modern amenities, roadways and educational system for your children. We did this, and our American Confederate flag is a representation of the growth we created. We will fight to have it become the modern symbol of America.”

This nation is not for you. It was no coincidence that those who opposed the civil rights movement for desegregation and integration across America began to resurrect the use of the flag in the 1950s and 1960s.

“We refuse to stop until ALL monuments are destroyed,” said Sharon Lewis, who has been part of this new movement since its inception. “I am an ally of people of color and will continue to be their voice through this awakening. If you don’t tear it down, we will! Prepare for Civil War II.”

Stonemason Collen Williamson trained enslaved people on the spot at the government’s quarry at Aquia, Virginia while enslaved people quarried and cut the rough stone.

The payroll to slaveowners shows that the government did not own slaves, but that it did hire them from their masters. Slave carpenters Ben, Daniel, and Peter were noted as owned by James Hoban.

Lewis also stated that there will be a gathering of 2 million people in front of the White House this weekend. “We are prepared to storm the front doors of the White House. Most of us are willing to give our lives for this movement. They can’t kill us all before we reach the entrance and burn this monument of hate to the ground.”

Hispanics, African-Americans, and anti-Trump activists held up signs and chanted outside the meeting area with hopes to get their point across.

That’s when one of the little girls decided to speak her mind about what she thought of police.

“I was walking behind the mom and her kids when I saw the little girl pull a Lego out of her pocket,” said Shauntee McPherson. “Then that little girl threw it right at the cops head! Then she called him a pig! I can’t believe what I saw and what I heard. That mom should be ashamed of herself! I mean, I don’t like cops that much myself. But damn!

Other protesters tried to stop him as well, but they were taken down by surrounding police officers. In all, 10 people were arrested for trying to protect the child.

“Building a fence is not enough,” Donald Trump said during speech. “Once they get to the US, which they will, legally or illegally, they will begin populating this country with large amounts of children. The American people, who have put their blood, sweat, and tears into this country, are not okay with that. I am proposing a one child law for Hispanics immediately at the beginning of my term – let’s make America great again!”

If Trump gets his way, the law that he is proposing would go into effect for Hispanics on visas, Hispanics applying for citizenship, and undocumented Hispanics. Hispanic families who received citizenship prior to 2016 would not be affected by this new law. If a pregnancy results in the birth of twins, then two children will be permitted. The government will provide free medical services for tubal ligation’s and vasectomies immediately following the birth of their first child, if Donald Trump’s law goes into effect.

Some qualities and characteristics are solely individual and don’t concern our attitude towards people around us, while others are significant and important for building our view of the world and relations with it, such as sincerity, loyalty, respect, and tolerance.

The latter two are the qualities that form the basis of modern society. The world isn’t as wide as it once was. Borders and boundaries are blurred, bringing people from different cultures and nations together and forming a multicultural environment we’ve never seen before. The views on traditional relationships and family are changing too. How important are tolerance and respect these days?

The role of tolerance today:

The modern world is a world of dialogue and multilingualism of cultures. We’re on the path to expanding the connections between various countries and peoples, and the rapid growth of cultural exchanges and direct contacts between social groups, social movements, and people proves it. The globe speaks different languages, and misunderstandings are inevitable. With all this diversity, tolerance serves as an instrument that helps to overcome cultural differences when we can’t understand what causes them.

Let’s take such a hot topic as religion as an example. In a perfect world, what you believe in is a personal matter, but in reality, it takes one critical comment about religion on social media to hurt someone’s feelings and start a fight. There are only two ways to end religious disputes once and for all: either to merge all religions and beliefs into one or abandon them in favor of atheistic views. It’s unlikely that we’ll ever see one of these options working, so tolerance is the only way to resolve religion-related conflicts and arguments peacefully.

Another aspect that causes controversy is rapidly changing family values. It seems like some part of the male population will never accept the growing role of women in relationship building. Families led by women are still frowned upon, but thanks to tolerance, the tendency is changing.

The role of respect

If tolerance is the instrument, then respect is the mechanism that makes it work. Respect has always been a crucial part of our daily lives, surrounding us on multiple levels. We respect age, wisdom, laws, traditions, and so on. In our time, “respect” is no longer a concept but feeling. We respect someone or something because it should be granted it. For instance, we give respect to the law because we have to or disrespect some people just because we can.

It’s impossible to learn tolerance without learning how to respect. And that’s a tricky task too because of a strong belief that respect must be earned. Some folks just can’t understand why they should tolerate sexual minorities or feminists simply because they’re out there fighting for their rights.

While the lack of respect towards others makes it harder to accept different views, nations, and cultures, the lack of it in a relationship can ruin a family, as it implies freedom and trust between partners. There are too many ways to lose respect for the significant other. Selfish actions, secrets, or, conversely, oversharing in relationships destroy confidence and trust that form respect.

So, without respect, there’s no tolerance, and without tolerance, the world wouldn’t be as colorful and diverse as it is today. Together, the two create a subtle balance between love and hate, allowing us to stay open for new sensations and experiences.",The Importance of Tolerance and Respect in the Modern World,fake

Daniel reportedly testified against numerous fellow gang members including rappers Jim Jones and Cardi B. However, it is also being reported that Daniel allegedly testified against the infamous Zodiac Killer to reduce his sentence even further than planned. Daniel identified the zodiac killer him as “Lawrence Gill” of Vallejo, California.

“The Zodiac Killer” is the name given to an unidentified serial killer who was active during the 1960s and 1970s in Northern California, allegedly committing murders in numerous cities including San Francisco, Vallejo, Benicia, and Lake Berryessa. The Zodiac Killer has remained one of the biggest criminal mysterious in modern history with the killer never caught or identified. According to authorities, Daniel identified The Zodiac Killer by name, as well as the city in which he hailed from.

According to authorities, Daniel’s claims to the Zodiac Killers identity don’t give much hope, as they say it is unlikely that Daniel would have any knowledge on the killers identity, but that it was worth keeping in mind, considering how compliant Daniel has been with authorities since being arrested. “I need to get out here asap” Daniel to the judge, “i’m not STOOPID” he then shouted. “It’s nice to have a snitch”, said the judge overseeing the case, “It’s not that common”.

Although unlikely, if Daniel’s claim to the zodiac killers identity is true, Daniel can have all charges dropped and even rewarded in free tattoos and marijuana, as well as citizenship for his parents for helping solve such a high profile case.

So it’s natural that people would try to bring down those symbols.”

In their Vanity Fair conversation, Davis told DuVernay that the Black Lives Matter riots and “defund the police” movement represent the culmination of decades of radical left-wing activism.

“The protests offered people an opportunity to join in this collective demand to bring about deep change, radical change,” Davis said. “Defund the police, abolish policing as we know it now. These are the same arguments that we’ve been making for such a long time about the prison system and the whole criminal justice system. It was as if all of these decades of work by so many people, who received no credit at all, came to fruition.”

Angela Davis also equated capitalism with racism. “Capitalism has always been racial capitalism,” she told DuVernay. “Wherever we see capitalism, we see the influence and the exploitation of racism.”

She also pushed for free healthcare and childcare as a way of redressing racism. “Not only should there be free education, but there should be free childcare and there should be free health care as well.

Westernjournal.com reports: As Van Drew was elected to higher and higher office, however, eventually ending up in Washington D.C., he described noticing that “things were changing” within the party.

“The Democratic Party had become less accepting of American tradition, less believing in American exceptionalism, less supportive of traditional faith and family,” Van Drew said. “This was not the party that I knew.”

“The party had moved from liberal to radical,” the congressman added, describing the early days of his House tenure, which coincided with those of then-newly elected New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and her far-left “squad.”

“This new Democratic Party wasn’t just for higher taxes. Now, they were for open borders, against our police and against our God-given rights,” he said.

Rumors swirled throughout House Democratic impeachment proceedings last December that Van Drew was considering a departure from the party.

The congressman was one of just two Democrats to vote against the failed proceedings, which proved deeply divisive not only on the Hill but in the national polls as well.

It was not until after votes were cast and Van Drew had met with Trump in the Oval Office, however, that he officially switched parties.

The former First Lady criticized white Americans in the latest edition of The Michelle Obama Podcast, stating that white people gave her dogs more attention than her during the presidency of her husband Barack Obama.

“When I’ve been completely incognito during the eight years in the White House, walking the dogs on the canal, people will come up and pet my dogs, but will not look me in the eye. They don’t know it’s me,” Obama recounted, adding later: “That is so telling of how white America views people who are not like them, like we don’t exist. And when we do exist, we exist as a threat. And that’s exhausting.”

During another part of the podcast, Obama recounted at great length how a woman, who apparently didn’t see her, cut in front of her for ice cream and this proves she was racist.

“We had just finished taking the girls to a soccer game. We were stopping to get ice cream and I had told the Secret Service to stand back, because we were trying to be normal, trying to go in,” Obama recalled. “There was a line, and… when I’m just a black woman, I notice that white people don’t even see me. They’re not even looking at me.”

“So I’m standing there with two little black girls, another black female adult, they’re in soccer uniforms, and a white woman cuts right in front of us to order. Like, she didn’t even see us,” the former first lady continued. “The girl behind the counter almost took her order. And I had to stand up ’cause I know Denielle was like, ‘Well, I’m not gonna cause a scene with Michelle Obama.’ So I stepped up and I said, ‘Excuse me? You don’t see us four people standing right here? You just jumped in line?‘”

She added: “She didn’t apologize, she never looked me in my eye, she didn’t know it was me. All she saw was a black person, or a group of black people, or maybe she didn’t even see that.

Protesters chanted accusations of “pedophile” outside the gates of Buckingham Palace, while waving banners featuring Prince Andrew’s face and containing messages condemning his crimes.

The protests were organized through a Facebook event page called, ‘Freedom For The Children Global Walk London.’

A post on the event page read:

“The purpose of this walk for change is to bring awareness to the current reality of child exploitation within our own communities and around the world. Let’s show our devotion and determination toward protecting these children, our communities most vulnerable, by requesting change and reformation within our government and law enforcement agencies to ensure that justice is brought in such a manner that it will significantly reduce instances of child exploitation while promoting awareness in order to end this ongoing issue.”

In footage later released of the protest, protesters can be seen waving banners with Prince Andrew’s face along with messages condemning his crimes.

Meanwhile, Prince Andrew has been dodging investigators that want to question him about the accusations made by some of Epstein’s victims.

New York prosecutors have said that the prince has “completely shut the door” on cooperating with authorities. They are now considering what further legal action can be taken.

Andrew continues to deny any wrongdoing or knowledge of Epstein’s many crimes, despite a growing body of evidence indicating that he was involved.

Manhattan Attorney Geoffrey Berman described the prince as a “co-conspirator.”

“Contrary to Prince Andrew’s very public offer to cooperate with our investigation into Epstein’s co-conspirators, an offer that was conveyed via press release, Prince Andrew has now completely shut the door on voluntary cooperation and our office is considering its options,” Berman said, according to the Guardian.

Andrew has previously promised to help investigators with the case, but has since removed himself from public life. He has also refused requests for interviews that investigators have sent him. He has stepped down from his official royal position and is now more than ever the black sheep of the royal family.

After the arrest of alleged Epstein co-conspirator Ghislaine Maxwell, who is also said to be good friends with Andrew, the prince has canceled all of his travels and business trips outside of the UK, likely out of fears that he will be arrested as well.

According to a former member of the Royal guard who worked on Prince Andrew’s security detail, The London Metropolitan Police have destroyed evidence that could have revealed where Prince Andrew was on the night that he is accused of having sex with a teenager that was being trafficked by Epstein and Maxwell.

The night in question is March 10th, 2001, as well as the morning hours of March 11. Virginia Giuffre, who was known by the name Virginia Roberts at the time, says that she was taken to London by Epstein and Maxwell and was expected to have sex with Prince Andrew. Giuffre says that she was just 17-years-old at the time.","Huge Crowd Gathers at Buckingham Palace, Demands ‘Pedophile’ Prince Andrew Face Justice",fake

Rand Paul and his wife were attacked by a large mob of Black Lives Matter protesters last night who shoved the police escorting him out of the RNC conference, knocking one of the officers into the Senator.

During an appearance on Fox & Friends this morning, Sen. Paul thanked the police for saving his life and condemned the leftist plan to defund the police.

“We’ve got to wake up, we can’t have Joe Biden rule the country and have no police. I mean, we can’t walk down the street safely in D.C. now. That’s how bad it is,” said Sen. Paul.

Video shows Paul and wife Kelley being surrounded by dozens of activists and aggressively accosted as they leave the Republican National Convention, where Trump had just accepted the party’s nomination, as police officers try to hold the crowd back.

At one point an officer holding a bicycle to shield the couple from the demonstrators was shoved backwards, stumbling into Paul and almost knocking the Kentucky senator to the ground.

Watch the latest video at foxnews.com

DailyMail report: After being escorted safely to his hotel, Paul tweeted thanking police, saying there were ‘over 100 activists’ and that officers had ‘literally saved our lives‘ from the ‘crazed mob‘.

A large crowd that included Black Lives Matter activists had gathered near the White House on Thursday night in an attempt to drown out Donald Trump’s acceptance speech with firecrackers and airhorns.

Later, video showed Black Lives Matter activists aggressively harassing people leaving the White House after Trump’s speech.

One man was punched in the back of the head and later knocked to the ground by a mob of activists who also threw water over him.

Meanwhile RNC committeeman Chris Ager and his wife were repeatedly abused by a balaclava-wearing protester who threatened to ‘f*** you up’ as they tried to get into the doors of their hotel.

Speaking to Fox News this morning, Paul said: ‘They would have killed us had the police not been there.

‘The threats were to f— you up, to you know, to kill you. The threats were if they could get ahold of you, and I truly believe with every fiber of my being, had they gotten at us, they would have gotten us to the ground.

‘We might not have been killed. We might just have been injured by being kicked in the head or kicked in the stomach until we were senseless. You’ve seen the pictures. Most of the networks will not show the pictures of this. This is happening in all of our cities. Its got to stop and thank God for the police.”

‘Had we not gotten to the police, I truly leave that the police saved our lives, and we would not be here today, or we’d be in a hospital today had the police not been there.’

The Black Lives Matter movement is particularly strong in Kentucky, which Rand represents, following the police killing of Breonna Taylor.

Paul has been active in pushing for police reform following the shooting, in which officers used a no-knock warrant to kick in the door of the 26-year-old EMT’s home before opening fire, killing her.

The senator has introduced legislation that would ban the use of no-knock warrants, and has dubbed it the Justice for Breonna Taylor Act.

‘After talking with Breonna Taylor’s family, I’ve come to the conclusion that it’s long past time to get rid of no-knock warrants,‘ Paul said as the bill was introduced back in June.

Breitbart reports: The president accused the Biden campaign and Biden himself of speaking up, finally, for political reasons.

“Now, they’re starting to mention it because their poll numbers are going down like a rock in water,” Trump said. “Too late, Joe.”

Trump spoke about the weeks of violent left-wing protests, looting, and arsonists taking advantage of civil unrest to create anarchy in America’s major cities.

“Joe Biden’s campaign did not condemn it; they donated to it,” Trump said, recalling members of Biden’s campaign publicly trumpeting their donations to the Minnesota Freedom Fund, which helped bail out arrested protesters and agitators in Minneapolis.

“At least 13 members of Joe Biden’s campaign staff donated to a fund to bail out vandals, arsonists, anarchists, looters, and rioters from jail,” he said.

Instead, Trump pointed to the death of retired police Captain David Dorn, who was shot and killed during the riots in Saint Louis while trying to protect a store from being looted.

The U.S. Constitution defines treason as waging war on the U.S. or giving “aid and comfort” to American enemies. Punishment for the crime may include the death penalty.

During a House hearing Thursday, Schiff tried to ramp up criticism of President Trump portraying him as a mob boss.

“It reads like a classic organized crime shakedown,” Schiff said of Trump’s call. “Shorn of its rambling character and in not so many words, this is the essence of what the president communicates.”

He then parodied Trump’s call in wildly inaccurate terms.

“We’ve been very good to your country, very good. No other country has done as much as we have, but you know what? I don’t see much reciprocity here,” Schiff said, supposedly “parodying” Trump’s demands to the Ukrainian leader. “I have a favor I want from you, though, and I’m gonna say this only seven times, so you better listen good. I want you to make up dirt on my political opponent, understand, lots of it.”

Schiff explained he was trying to make clear what the president “was trying to communicate with the president of Ukraine.”

“This is, in some character, what the president was trying to communicate with the president of Ukraine,” Schiff said. “It would be funny if it wasn’t such a graphic betrayal of the president’s oath of office.”

“[W]e don’t think the president of that regime is in control,” Assad told the paper, referring to Trump. “We all believe that the deep state, the real state, is in control, or is in control of every president, and that is nothing new.

At least that’s what mining engineer W. Warren Shufelt claimed in the January 29, 1934 edition of the Los Angeles Times. According to reporter Jean Bosquet, Shufelt was ready to dig up downtown L.A. in search of this ancient subterranean civilization.

Shufelt had first heard of the city in a Hopi Indian legend about the “Lizard People.” They were a fabled lost race who had who had nearly been wiped out after a meteor shower rained down on the Southwest back around 3,000 BC. (Arizona’s famous Winslow Crater was said to be Ground Zero of this fiery deluge.)

The Lizard People constructed thirteen subterranean settlements along the Pacific Coast, to shelter the tribe against future disasters. These underground cities housed a thousand families each, along with stockpiles of food. As the story had it, the tribe used a “chemical solution” that melted solid bedrock to bore out the tunnels and rooms of their subsurface shelters.

Along with housing their people in the event of a disaster, the tunnels were also constructed to hold a trove of golden tablets that chronicled the tribe’s history, the origin of humankind, and the story of the world back to creation. Shufelt was particularly interested in these tablets for both pecuniary and archeological reasons.

A Hopi chief named Little Green Leaf told Shufelt that the vanished race’s capital city was located under present-day downtown Los Angeles. In 1933, after surveying the area, Shufelt occupied the Banning property at 518 North Hill Street and sank a 350-shaft straight down, digging for what he said was a “treasure room” directly underneath. Shufelt said that he had located gold in the catacombs below with the aid of his “radio X-ray.”

This peculiar instrument, which was sort of a tricked-up dowsing rod, had also helped Shufelt map the location and extent of the underground tunnels. He said that the subterranean city was shaped like a giant lizard, with the head in the vicinity of Chavez Ravine (the present location of Dodger Stadium), and the tail tapering out beneath the Central Library. The “key room,” the chamber that contained the map of the city and the directory to the gold tablets, lay several hundred feet under the present site of Times-Mirror Square. Shufelt also claimed that he’d traced passages stretching to the area around the Southwest Museum, and said that ventilation tunnels extended westward, opening at the Pacific Ocean.

Despite all his extensive mapping and plotting of the treasure-filled underground city, Shufelt never actually found it. Shortly after the Times story appeared, the project, which had been authorized by the City Council over a year earlier, suddenly ceased, and Shufelt and his cohorts disappeared. The whole mysterious, improbable business was written off by a hoax, and quickly forgotten. Since then, inexplicable tunnels have been unearthed in downtown Los Angeles, but they’ve usually been explained away as the work of smugglers hiding illegal Chinese laborers in the 19th century.

But Shufelt wasn’t the only modern Californian who believed that an ancient underground city lay beneath Los Angeles. As a postscript to this strange little tale, let’s look at the vision of Miss Edith Elden Robinson of Pico Rivera, which appeared in the highly respected American Society for Psychic Research’s journal.",Los Angeles: City of Ancient Lizard People?,fake

The West Morgan-East Lawrence Water Authority (WMEL) warned people not to use their tap water for drinking or cooking, as it has been contaminated with potentially hazardous chemicals that could cause cancer, birth defects and developmental problems in children.

RT reports:

The warning comes on the heels of a US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) advisory that revealed higher than previously thought levels of synthetic chemicals known as PFOS (Perfluorooctane sulfonate) and PFOA (perfluorooctanoic acid) in Alabama waters. Scientists found PFOS and PFOA in the blood of “nearly all the people they tested,” but in low concentrations, the EPA said in its May 19 warning.

WMEL general manager Don Sims has advised residents in Lawrence and Morgan Counties to avoid tap water for either drinking or cooking until further notice.

The utility supplies water to nearly 100,000 people in the two counties, as well as up to 10,000 direct residential customers.

“I recommend that all our customers do not drink our water, until we are able to bring the temporary system our engineer is designing online,” Sims said at a news conference.

The warning covers not only fresh water, but even water boiled and filtered at home, since neither method can remove the chemical contaminants.

After building up in people and animals over time, PFOS and PFOA can also cause liver and thyroid damage, as well as immune system problems, with small children and expectant women the two categories most at risk.

“I would rather be over-cautious than under-cautious,” Sims said. “I’m not a doctor, I’m not a chemist, but when they tell one class of people the water is not safe, I don’t want to be the one to say ‘you drink it and you don’t.’ So I said nobody drink it.”

The warning could remain in place until at least the fall, when a $4 million “temporary system” is expected to replace the current one, possibly in September, according to news website AL.com.

In the meantime, the water authority said that it has no “means to provide bottled water for its customers in the interim,”AL.com reported.

The temporary filter is supposed to support the affected Alabama counties until at least 2019, when a permanent system will become operational. Sims has previously estimated that the filter will cost from $30 to $50 million, AL.com reported.

The water authority determined that the chemical contamination came from companies located upstream on the Tennessee River, including the 3M Company, which discharges PFOS and PFOA in their manufacturing processes. The synthetic chemicals are widely used to make nonstick cookware, waterproof clothes, carpet sealants and fire-fighting foams.

According to AL.com, 3M vice president and corporate medical director Dr. Carol Ley counters the claim that the chemicals pose a risk, saying that the company’s workers, who are in contact with them for long periods of time, have not shown any evidence that exposure is detrimental to their health.

Their concern is such that Washington has threatened that even a conventional attack on Idlib, a province branded “a terrorist nest” By Russia, could result in military action from the US and its allies.

Syrian government forces are reportedly preparing to liberate the northwestern province from the terrorists.

RT reports: Idlib, it seems, is different: The US military has always found a way to justify its anti-terrorism operations – even in urban areas. In fact, as Nicolas J. S. Davies, author of ‘Blood On Our Hands: The American Invasion and Destruction of Iraq’, told RT, the US military continues to loosen its rules of engagement so that its bombing campaigns don’t run into any red tape.

“The Obama administration had already loosened rules of engagement in the war against Islamic State in Syria and Iraq to permit more killing of civilians in the bombing campaign the US conducted,” Davies said.

“They expended over 100,000 bombs and missiles to destroy cities like Raqqa and Mosul. President Trump has reportedly loosened rules of engagement further.”

RT’s Igor Zhdanov looks into how the US approach in fighting terrorists differs depending on the region – or the motive

Meanwhile, Washington’s threats to take military action to deter a Syrian assault on the terrorist held province has prompted Fox News host Tucker Carlson to ask the obvious question:

Why would the US bomb a country to protect terrorists?

Tucker Carlson: More than 10k rebels in that province are believed to be allied with Al-Qaeda. So that would mean that 17 years after 9/11, America could soon find itself bombing a country to protect Al-Qaeda sympathizers.

Apple and the U.S. government have become embroiled in the latest privacy debate following a federal judge ordering Apple to assist the FBI in their access of a phone used by a San Bernardino shooter.

The Guardian reports:

Apple has refused, arguing that to do so would set a legal precedent that could force it to hack a suspect’s phone each time authorities face a warrant. It argues that would violate user trust, privacy norms and weaken the core security of the company’s flagship smartphone.

Early Friday, the Justice Department released a lengthy legal filing that accused Apple of misinterpreting the law and placing marketing goals over national security.

Apple’s legal team was huddled Friday preparing a response and declined to speak on the record. But in several calls with reporters, a senior Apple executive agreed to offer some response on the condition of anonymity and that reporters not quote the executive’s exact words.

The company’s executive said that the Justice Department’s request was so unprecedented that no other country – specifically mentioning China – had asked for similar access. That comes following reports that the country, a huge market for Apple, has asked to inspect western technology products for “security”.

The company executive also said it was safe to assume that Apple would continue to add more security features to its products to make it harder still for investigators to get access.

The company’s latest spat with the FBI goes back to the fall of 2014, when Apple expanded the default use of encryption on its newer iPhones. At the time, it said it would no longer be able to retrieve passcodes used to unlock phones for federal agents.

The FBI conceded this week it can’t force Apple to give it the passcode, but it concocted a clever workaround. It persuaded a judge to order Apple to make it easier to guess the passcode by weakening other countermeasures.

On the call Apple acknowledged that, on a technical level, the workaround could be applied to any iPhone. Authorities would have to get a warrant for each of those cases.

In its filing Friday, the government said that it had tried several other ways to access gunman Syed Farook’s phone, which was owned by his employer – the county agency he targeted. One of them would have been to return his iPhone to his home wireless network to see if it would automatically back up its files on Apple’s iCloud service.

This potentially could have given investigators access to Farook’s files and iMessages up to the moment of the attack.

However, Apple and federal agents discovered that option wouldn’t work. In the hours after the shooting, San Bernardino county staff tried to access Farook’s iCloud account and reset his password. This, unintentionally, triggered an Apple security measure that made it impossible to back up the phone.

The Apple executive conceded there is no way to know if this would have worked. It’s possible, as the government argues, that Farook had turned off the auto-update function. The phone last updated on 19 October, some six weeks before the shooting.

Y: Cube, developed by the YMCA, offer 26 square meter prefabricated ‘studio’ apartments that can be easily built almost anywhere.

According to the charity, the housing blocks provide everything from clean water to central heating, making them the ideal home for people working in London unable to afford the capital’s rent.

One unit costs around £30,000 to build, and are let for £140 per week, making the units 65 percent cheaper than standard London accommodation.

The units were developed with Roger Strik Harbour, an award winning architect partially owned by Baron Rogers of Riverside, which specializes in functionalist structures.

Closely resembling the red hotels found on a Monopoly board, the units can also be stacked in a tower in order to save space and fit more residents.

“The average disposable income going on housing now is going on fifty percent. People are having to make huge compromises, they’re having to share flats, share houses. Ideally, what people want is their own front door,” YMCA Director of Housing and Development Andy Readfearn told RT.

“So there’s a massive, massive gap and what we want to do is begin to address that, challenge the sector to provide choice and give hope to people.

“You have to innovate, you have to bring different people to the market. Y: Cube is our solution. This allows us to procure accommodation quickly, we can keep these rents really low so everyone benefits,” he added.

Such solutions come as homelessness is spiking across the UK.’

Bevin pardoned Micah Schoettle, 41, who was convicted in 2018 of raping the young child in Kenton County and sentenced to 23 years in prison.

Schoettle walked out of prison a free man on Wednesday after only having served less than 18 months behind bars.

Officials say Schoettle will not have to register as a sex offender, and he can even have his conviction wiped clean from his record.

Wcpo.com reports: The prosecutor in his case, the victim’s family and others on social media have railed against Bevin’s decision to pardon Schoettle, one of 428 Kentuckians he pardoned or whose sentences he commuted earlier this week.

‘Shame on him’

The mother of Schoettle’s victim, whom WCPO is not identifying to protect her family, said learning of his pardon felt like “a slap in the face.”

“It feels like we’re going through it all over again … we just got to the point where we felt safe leaving the house and not looking over our shoulders,” she told WCPO.

The middle-school student who first accused Schoettle in 2016 told Florence police he had repeatedly sexually assaulted her since she was 9 years old.

Though a jury convicted Schoettle of rape, sodomy and sexual abuse in 2018, he walked free with the governor’s pardon Wednesday.

When the victim’s mother learned of Schoettle’s release from Green River Correctional Center, she struggled to find the words to explain what happened to her daughter.

“‘Well, it figures. They always get away with it,'” she recalled her daughter saying.

In the pardon, Bevin wrote that the case relied on more testimony than physical evidence, and he did not believe the victim’s accusations were true, the Associated Press reports.

“[Bevin has] met my daughter, and now he’s saying that my daughter is a liar … Shame on him. Shame on him,” she said.

WCPO reached out to Bevin’s family company for further comment but did not hear back.

Prosecutor calls pardon ‘irresponsible,’ ‘abomination’ of justice

Law enforcement will not monitor Schoettle, since he will not have to register as a sex offender in Northern Kentucky, according to Commonwealth’s Attorney Rob Sanders.

In Schoettle’s pardon, Bevin wrote that the prosectuor’s case relied more on testimony over physical evidence.

But Sanders said the governor’s office never contacted prosecutors, victims or local law enforcement about clemency for Schoettle.

“It shocks the conscience,” Sanders said. “It’s offensive, it’s mind-boggling how any governor could be this irresponsible. It’s an abomination of the criminal justice system.”

Kentucky governors have pardoned criminals as their last acts in the past. In 2015, Steve Beshear pardoned or commuted the sentences of roughly 200 people. In neighboring Ohio, Governor John Kasich granted 66 of 1,521 clemency requests in a four-year period, according to the Associated Press.

But Sanders said that Bevin’s most recent pardons are especially “offensive” to victims.

“Prosecutors all across Kentucky today are disgusted with Matt Bevin, offended by Matt Bevin — and rightfully so — and there are victims that have been victimized again,” Sanders said.

‘He got away with it’

The victim’s mother said her daughter went through three years of therapy to deal with the post-traumatic stress, but she has a “huge support system,” including volunteers from Bikers Against Child Abuse to watch over them.

But now that the man who sexually abused their daughter is free, the family says they’re the ones in hiding.

They are looking for a way to leave the Tri-State for good, still fearing what Schoettle might do to harm others.

168,https://newspunch.com/big-tech-ban-urls-counter-mainstream-narrative/,2019-03-20T21:16:47+00:00,Yournewswire,"Telecom giants in New Zealand have ordered Big Tech to outright ban URL’s that spread information that counters the mainstream narrative.

In the wake of last week’s terror attacks at two New Zealand mosques which left 50 dead, several independent websites have been partially or completely blacklisted in both New Zealand and Australia under the guise of “protecting consumers,” according to the CEOs of three New Zealand telcos.

Zerohedge.com reports: In the immediate aftermath of the shooting – which was broadcast over Facebook Live by accused gunman Brenton Tarrant to an initial audience of just 200 viewers (none of whom reported it) and had 4,000 overall views before it was taken down – Facebook deleted 1.5 million videos of the attack, of which 1.2 million were blocked at the time of upload.

In the first 24 hours we removed 1.5 million videos of the attack globally, of which over 1.2 million were blocked at upload… — Facebook Newsroom (@fbnewsroom) March 17, 2019

A video of the attacks is still freely available to anyone who wishes to download it from bittorrent.

Twitter has also been aggressively censoring content related to the Christchurch shooting – perhaps most egregiously forcing journalist Nick Monroe to delete a large number of tweets as he covered the incident in real time, just one of which had links to footage of the shooting. Document hosting website Scribd, meanwhile, has been deleting copies of Tarrant’s 74-page manifesto.

In addition to documenting the incident, Monroe has been noting the mass censorship surrounding the shootings – as well as things such as the New Zealand herald stealth editing a March 15 article to remove mention of a “well known Muslim local” who “chased the shooters and fired two shots at them as they sped off.”

That said, Twitter and Facebook’s suppression hasn’t gone far enough according to New Zealand telecom CEOs, who have penned an open letter to Facebook, Twitter and Google suggesting that they follow European proposals for hyper-vigilant policing of content for the sake of ‘protecting consumers.’

“Consumers have the right to be protected, whether using services funded by money or data. Now is the time for this conversation to be had and we call on all of you to join us at the table and be part of the solution,” reads the letter.

Zero Hedge banned… again.

Less than a week after Facebook ‘mistakenly’ banned us for two days with no explanation following several reports which were critical of the social media giant, we learned that Zero Hedge has now been banned in New Zealand and Australia, despite the fact that we never hosted video footage of the Christchurch attack. We were not contacted prior to the censorship. Instead, we have received a steady flood of people noting that the site is unavailable in the two countries unless a VPN is used.

And while Australia and New Zealand account for a negligible amount of traffic to Zero Hedge, the stunning arrogance of NZ and OZ telcos to arbitrarily impose nanny-state restrictions on content is more than a little disturbing, and should – at least in a so-called democracy – be subject to majority vote.

Also banned down under are the ‘chans’ and video hosting platform LiveLeak, among others.

The letter continues:

“You may be aware that on the afternoon of Friday 15 March, three of New Zealand’s largest broadband providers, Vodafone NZ, Spark and 2degrees, took the unprecedented step to jointly identify and suspend access to web sites that were hosting video footage taken by the gunman related to the horrific terrorism incident in Christchurch,” reads the joint letter from Vodafone’s Jason Paris, and NZ telcos Spark and 2degrees Simon Moutter Stewart Sherriff.

“As key industry players, we believed this extraordinary step was the right thing to do in such extreme and tragic circumstances. Other New Zealand broadband providers have also taken steps to restrict availability of this content, although they may be taking a different approach technically,” the letter continues.

We also accept it is impossible as internet service providers to prevent completely access to this material. But hopefully we have made it more difficult for this content to be viewed and shared – reducing the risk our customers may inadvertently be exposed to it and limiting the publicity the gunman was clearly seeking.”

“Internet service providers are the ambulance at the bottom of the cliff, with blunt tools involving the blocking of sites after the fact. The greatest challenge is how to prevent this sort of material being uploaded and shared on social media platforms and forums.

“We call on Facebook, Twitter and Google, whose platforms carry so much content, to be a part of an urgent discussion at an industry and New Zealand Government level on an enduring solution to this issue.”

So while the telcos have defended their decision to censor a wide swath of material in order to shield people from dangerous information – and have encouraged social media platforms to commit to European-style information control, Kiwis and Australians will only get to know what the technocracy approves in order to ‘protect consumers.’

Ra’ad Al Hussein argued the point that in the early days of Nazi propaganda, they made public attacks through news on those they wanted to eliminate. This was all said during a recent interview where the topic of migrants was brought up as it is currently flooding global news.

According to RT report, UN human rights chief compares UK tabloids to ‘Nazi’ propaganda:

UK tabloids like the Murdoch-owned Sun that compared immigrants to ‘cockroaches’ recall the dark days of the Nazi media attacking those they sought to eliminate, according to the UN’s human rights chief.

“The Nazi media described people their masters wanted to eliminate as rats and cockroaches,” the UN high commissioner for human rights, Zeid Ra’ad Al Hussein said.

He singled out an article by former gameshow contestant turned-commentator Katie Hopkins, published by the Sun newspaper last Thursday, in which she wrote: “Make no mistake, these migrants are like cockroaches. They might look a bit ‘Bob Geldof’s Ethiopia circa 1984’, but they are built to survive a nuclear bomb. They are survivors.”

The comment piece was published just hours before a boat containing hundreds of displaced people capsized in the Mediterranean, killing 800.

“This type of language is clearly inflammatory and unacceptable, especially in a national newspaper. The Sun’s editors took an editorial decision to publish this article, and – if it is found in breach of the law – should be held responsible along with the author,” Zeid said.

Zeid said the Hopkins piece was by no means a one off, but rather the result of “decades of sustained and unrestrained anti-foreigner abuse, misinformation and distortion.”

“This vicious verbal assault on migrants and asylum seekers in the UK tabloid press has continued unchallenged under the law for far too long,” he said.

Like the Sun, Britain’s Daily Express was also a prime culprit, he said.

“To give just one glimpse of the scale of the problem, back in 2003 the Daily Express ran 22 negative front pages stories about asylum seekers and refugees in a single 31-day period,” he said.

“Asylum seekers and migrants have, day after day, for years on end, been linked to rape, murder, diseases such as HIV and TB, theft, and almost every conceivable crime and misdemeanor imaginable in front-page articles and two-page spreads, in cartoons, editorials, even on the sports pages of almost all the UK’s national tabloid newspapers.”

Zeid said from a legal perspective free speech and hate speech were clearly delineated.

“I am an unswerving advocate of freedom of expression, which is guaranteed under Article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), but it is not absolute.

“Article 20 of the same covenant says: ‘Any advocacy of national, racial or religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence shall be prohibited by law.”

According to Damascus, the shelling was the result of attempts by some countries to “facilitate” delivery of chemicals to terrorist groups and to further frame the Syrian government.

The Syrian Foreign Ministry has called on the UN Security Council to immediately condemn the “terrorist crimes,” and take “deterrent and punitive measures against the states and regimes backing terrorism.”

RT reports:The Al-Khalidiye and Al Zahraa neighborhoods, as well as Nile Street, were targeted by rocket fire on Saturday evening, Syria’s state SANA news agency reported. The munitions used by the rebels were rigged with toxic gas, causing dozens of civilians to suffer from asphyxiation, the agency said.

The hazardous substance has been preliminarily identified as chlorine, according to medical officials.

The head of the health department of the Syrian city of Aleppo, Ziad Haj Taha, reported that 50 people were taken to two Aleppo hospitals after the shelling, noting that the number of the injured is likely to rise.

“Ambulance services continue to provide assistance to victims of poison gas use by terrorist groups, presumably chlorine,” Taha told Russian Sputnik news agency.

The Russian Defense Ministry has dispatched chemical protection troops stationed in Syria to the area. They are tending to those affected and monitoring the situation on the ground, ministry spokesman Major General Igor Konashenkov told media.

“From preliminary data, in particular the confirmed symptoms displayed by those affected, the munitions used in the shelling were filled with chlorine,” Konashenkov said. According to the Russian military’s data, 46 people, including 8 children, were hospitalized after the shelling.

Footage from the Aleppo hospital released by the Russian Ministry of Defense shows injured civilians, including women and children, being tended to by the doctors. A choking woman is seen being rushed into the hospital in a wheelchair. Patients are wearing oxygen masks.

Doctors told RT that the hospital has been filled with a distinct chemical smell. Patients “see very badly and have big difficulties breathing,” a doctor said.

The number of civilians treated for the symptoms of gas poisoning has climbed to 73 people, including 4 children, Syrian medical officials reported early Sunday. All of the injured have experienced problems with breathing and watery eyes, the symptoms that are consistent with an allergic reaction to gas, doctor Shervan Shekho told journalists.

According to the Russian military’s preliminary estimates, the attack was launched from within the nearby Idlib de-escalation zone, from an area near a village controlled by the former Al-Nusra front.

Chlorine, which was first used as a weapon during WWI, may cause lasting health damage and can be fatal at high levels of exposure.

Children and women are reported to be among the victims of the attack.

The Syrian armed forces fired back, targeting the positions of the militants north of Aleppo, a SANA correspondent reported, adding that they appear to have suffered heavy losses.

“The Syrian army responded to the shelling of militants, attacking the positions from which the shelling was carried out, militants suffered significant losses,” a Syrian military source confirmed the retaliatory attack to Sputnik.

SANA has released a video showing purported victims of the attack wearing oxygen masks as they are being treated in an Aleppo hospital.

Moscow has repeatedly accused anti-government rebels of plotting a chemical weapons attack with the possible goal of framing Damascus. Last month, the Russian Defense Ministry reported that a hardline Islamist group affiliated with the Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS/ISIL) got hold of two canisters filled with chlorine after raiding the headquarters of rival Jabhat al-Nusra group [rebranded as Hayat Tahrir al-Sham].",Dozens Hospitalized In Syria’s Aleppo After Militants Shell City With Toxic Gas,fake

You will seldom hear a Hollywood actress speaking out against the craziness of feminism these days. That’s why it was so refreshing to read the views of actress Actress Kaley Cuoco-Sweeting on the issue. She stars in the popular sitcom, “The Big Bang Theory”, and she is making quite an impact of her own. When asked in a Redbook interview if she was a feminist, she responded with,

Is it bad if I say no? It’s not really something I think about.

Things are different now, and I know a lot of the work that paved the way for women happened before I was around. I was never that feminist girl demanding equality, but maybe that’s because I’ve never really faced inequality.

I cook for Ryan five nights a week: It makes me feel like a housewife; I love that. I know it sounds old-fashioned, but I like the idea of women taking care of their men. I’m so in control of my work that I like coming home and serving him. My mom was like that, so I think it kind of rubbed off.

My goodness, did a Hollywood actress just say that she LIKED serving her husband? That poor naive woman! Doesn’t she know that taking care of your husband makes you weak? Hasn’t anyone told her that in order to be equal you have to participate in vile acts, like dressing up in vagina costumes or writing demands on your naked body? I mean, how else do you expect to be taken seriously?

Liberals have already started attacking Kaley on Twitter for her comments about feminism. One user tweeted,

“How can someone who is reaping the benefits of the feminist movement (via her large paycheck) not be a “feminist”?

Another offended liberal wrote, “Kaley Cuoco-Sweeting’s thoughts on feminism are as tragic as her haircut. Barf.”

Kaley responded on twitter by saying ” I apologize if I offended anyone. Anyone who knows me knows my heart and knows what I really meant. ”

Well, it’s good to know that there are still down to earth people out there, even if they are making millions. Kaley isn’t forgetting the people who helped her make those millions either.

My parents spent 16 years hauling my butt to LA for audition after audition. Every day they were helping me learn my lines, dropping me off, waiting for me, picking me up, giving me pep talks when I didn’t get the jobs, taking me to tennis and horseback riding lessons.

I remember always hoping I could help take care of them because they took such good care of me. Knowing I’ll be able to just brings tears to my eyes.

If you watched any of it, you would have heard some crazy things, but the REALLY crazy stuff was happening during the day, and the media didn’t show you any of that.

Tucker Carlson recently exposed this in a must-see segment on his show.

Here’s a partial transcript via FOX News:

Tucker reveals the DNC party leaders don’t want you to see, where extremism and anti-Americanism come out “You might not know this, but most of the actual convention events take place during daytime hours,” the “Tucker Carlson Tonight” host explained. “The networks don’t cover them. You have no idea they ever happen. There’s a reason for that, obviously, but what a loss for the viewing public.” At one event, Pastor Frederick Haynes III of Texas castigated President Trump and his supporters during a fiery opening prayer. “You had the nerve to build a wall while at the same time you have in the harbor there in New York a Statue of Liberty … Jesus will say, ‘America, if you don’t get your act together, you may well go to Hell,’” said Haynes at one point… Carlson then introduced J Mai, a graduate assistant at Wake Forest University’s LGBT Center whose biography describes them as a “Black Vietnamese transgender non-binary gender-transcendent mermaid queenking currently living out their ever-evolving truths in Winston-Salem.” “Why can’t folks imagine a world without the cops, why can’t folks imagine a world without prisons, why can’t people expand their imaginations to include community care, to include an abolitionist future?” Mai said in the clip. “I’m talking about for real-for real abolition, not just the watered-down DNC version of abolition. We’re talking about abolishing the police, we’re talking about abolishing ICE, we’re talking about abolishing prisons.”

Biden made the remark during his nationally televised acceptance speech for the Democrat Party’s presidential nomination at a near empty hotel convention center in Wilmington, Delaware.

Biden is a devout Catholic, or so the media and his campaign tell us:

Biden’s identity as “a very devout Catholic and person of deep faith,” deputy political director John McCarthy said, is “baked into the core messaging and core functions of the campaign.” Biden has framed his presidential bid as a fight for “the soul of the nation,” a subtle invocation of the Catholic beliefs that have guided his life. His campaign has released three digital ads focused on faith, including one crediting his religious practices with instilling a “sense of solace.”

Catholics believe in miracles, yet here was a haughty Joe Biden on Thursday night lying about President Trump’s response to the pandemic, lecturing Trump and America, “He keeps waiting for a miracle. Well, I have news for him: No miracle is coming.”

238,https://www.infowars.com/silent-majority-over-10-of-trump-voters-wont-admit-preferences-to-pollsters/,2020-08-28T20:06:36,infowars,"A new study from CloudResearch reveals that 11.7% of Republicans won’t admit their political preferences to pollsters – which is more than twice the number of Democrats at just 5.4%.

CloudResearch also found that “10.5% of Independents fell into the “shy voter” category, just a percentage point lower than how Republicans react to phone polls.”

When asked why they wouldn’t be truthful in their responses, “shy” respondents cited six concerns:

1. A lack of trust in phone polls as truly being anonymous.

2. An apprehension to associate their phone numbers with recorded responses.

3. Fear that their responses will become public in some manner.

4. Fear of reprisal and related detrimental impact to their financial, social, and family lives should their political opinions become publicly known.

5. A general dislike of phone polls.

6. Malicious intent to mislead polls due to general distrust of media and political pundits (though a sentiment expressed only by a few “shy voters”).

Specifically, the following explanations were given:

“I don’t believe the information would be confidential and I think it’s dangerous to express an opinion outside of the current liberal viewpoint.”

“Well I probably wouldn’t give my opinion period, but if pushed, I would not give my real opinion for fear of reprisal if someone found out.”

“Because most polls released to the public are slanted and aren’t scientifically based. So, they are messing with the results of the survey from the beginning by knocking down one party or the other. I’m just trying to right the ship.”

“My answers could be recorded so I don’t really trust such phone conversations.”

“I do not discuss politics — let alone with a total stranger on the telephone.”

“I don’t always trust phone call surveys. I wouldn’t want to be bombarded with phone calls and political mail.”

“I don’t want my opinion associated with my phone number.”

“I am less anonymous, and somewhat ashamed of my opinion as it is frowned upon.”

CloudResearch also found that the reluctance to give honest answers should not be interpreted as outright lying – rather, they are an indication of a lack of trust in the anonymity of polls, as well as a fear of reprisal if their opinions were to become public.

The results could have implications in terms of the true accuracy of phone polls; if Republicans, Independents and supporters of Donald Trump (regardless of party affiliation) are less likely to participate in polls or accurately disclose the candidate they support, that inherently generates biased poll outcomes.

Given razor thin-margins in the swing states, such bias may have important consequences, although more research is required to fully understand the potential magnitude of this effect. We intend to examine the magnitude of “shy-voter bias” in specific states like Arizona, Florida, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin over the coming weeks. –CloudResearch

And who can blame the silent majority – with Trump supporters having been actively targeted with violence and harassment in restaurants, at their homes, and walking in public.

So – between egregious oversampling of Democrats by polling companies, and Republicans won won’t admit to supporting Trump, it’s no wonder the polls have been dead wrong since 2016.

Merkel was asked about the policy during her annual summer press conference in Berlin on Friday. “When people are standing at the German-Austrian border or the Hungarian-Austrian border, they have to be treated like human beings,” the German leader told journalists.

The politician added that European nations will face similar tough decisions for many years to come. “The subject of migration … is not finished. It will be a constant theme for the 21st century,” she said.

There were roughly one million first-time asylum applications in Germany between 2015 and 2016 – one of the critical moments of Merkel’s 15-year tenure as chancellor of the European nation.

Despite an initial wave of popular support among the German people, the reality of Merkel’s immigration policy decision quickly gave way to skepticism and, later, controversy and a backlash, after a slew of high-profile incidents involving migrants, including numerous sexual assaults during the 2015-16 New Year’s Eve celebrations.

Some 1,250 women in at least 12 cities were reportedly sexually assaulted. At least 24 of the victims were raped – in most instances, by non-European men. The Berlin Christmas market attack in December 2016 only added insult to injury, and fuelled another wave of public outcry at home and abroad.

The authorities’ handling of both situations inflamed widespread skepticism of the migration policy and at least partially contributed to a surge in support for the anti-immigration AfD party, which gained a foothold in the German parliament for the first time in the 2017 federal elections.

Merkel also made a deal with Turkey, promising visa-free travel in Europe for Turkish citizens in exchange for Turkey stemming the tide of migration through its borders. This afforded Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan new leverage in negotiations with Brussels in the years to come, including in 2020, when he threatened to open the refugee floodgates if NATO did not back Turkish operations in Syria.

In 2019, some 1,345,943 foreigners migrated to Germany, compared with roughly 2,016,241 in 2015. Of these, 165,938 applied for refugee status, and 41,094 of those came from Syria. At least 54,034 applications were rejected, while 45,053 people were granted refugee status, according to figures from the country’s Federal Statistical Office.

241,https://www.infowars.com/farmers-quick-sale-of-poultry-during-outbreaks-increase-deadly-virus-transmission-study/,2020-08-28T19:32:39,infowars,"Small-scale poultry farmers in Vietnam tend to respond to viral outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) by rapidly selling their birds as a way to avoid financial loss, according to a new study by an international team of researchers.

As these birds are commingled with other birds in markets and trading networks, this practice may increase the likelihood of widespread disease transmission. The findings could have implications for government policymaking in the many regions of the world where small-scale poultry farming and avian influenza risk co-occur.

“Avian influenza is deadly to humans, with a case fatality rate between 25% and 50%,” said Maciej Boni, associate professor of biology, Penn State. Fortunately, reports of human-to-human transmission over the past 15 years have been either absent or anecdotal. COVID-19 took us by surprise, but with HPAI we have a known threat with the potential to become pandemic. If we ignore the active role that poultry farmers play in the control and dissemination of avian influenza, we may miss another opportunity to curtail an emerging disease outbreak at a stage when it is still controllable.”

Lead author Alexis Delabouglise, an animal health economist at CIRAD-Agricultural Research for Development in France who was a postdoctoral scholar at Penn State when the research was performed, explained that small-scale poultry farming is practiced by millions of Vietnamese households and by millions more throughout southeast Asia, mostly on a scale of fewer than 100 birds per farm. These farmers make decisions on a daily basis — often in response to economic incentives — about when and where to sell their flocks. And their decisions can influence disease spread.

“If the price of poultry goes up, farmers might expand their farming activities, which could create more outbreak risk,” said Delabouglise. “If there is an outbreak on a neighboring farm, they might choose to sell their poultry early to avoid their own birds from being infected and to avoid lower prices. And if there is an outbreak on their own farm, the evidence in our study shows that they would be likely to sell their birds early to avoid both monetary loss and epidemiological risk.”

Boni and colleagues, including researchers at the Oxford University Clinical Research Unit (OUCRU) in Ho Chi Minh City, conducted a longitudinal study of small-scale poultry farms in the Mekong river delta region of southern Vietnam with a goal of characterizing the effects of disease outbreaks on poultry harvest rates, as well as on two prevention practices — vaccination and farm disinfection. The team followed 53 farmers and their management of more than 1,000 poultry flocks for a period of two years — from 2015 to 2017.

“Working with partners in endemic countries day-in and day-out on study details and public health priorities is key to establishing collaborations that allow these long-term follow-up studies to succeed,” said Boni, who led a research group at OUCRU for eight years.

Delabouglise, the statistical lead on the project, used mixed-effects general additive models to investigate farmers’ probabilities of harvesting — either selling or slaughtering — flocks, of performing avian influenza vaccination on flocks that were not previously vaccinated and of disinfecting farm facilities when faced with an outbreak. Their findings appeared in eLife on August 25.

“We found that farmers did send their chickens to market early when there were outbreaks occurring on their farms,” said Delabouglise. “Specifically, small-scale farmers increased their harvest of broiler chickens by 56% during outbreaks with no sudden deaths and by 214% during outbreaks with sudden deaths. This has the potential to exacerbate the outbreak and spread the virus even further.”

The team noted that sudden deaths — the deaths of chickens less than one day after the onset of clinical symptoms — are considered to be indicative of HPAI infection. Interestingly, the team found that the probability of disinfection was not affected by the occurrence of outbreaks.

Finally, the team found that the likelihood of vaccination against avian influenza strongly increased with flock size. The probability of vaccination was almost zero for flocks of 16 birds or fewer and nearly 100% for flocks of more than 200 birds. According to Delabouglise, one reason that millions of small-scale poultry farmers may not be vaccinating their birds could be their desire to avoid transaction costs associated with declaring flocks to governmental veterinary services before vaccination. Another reason could be that due to their small size, their vaccination status is not controlled and, therefore, vaccination is less worthwhile from the farmers’ perspective.

“Crucially, it is these smaller flocks that are more likely to be sold into trading networks during outbreaks,” he said. “The rapid sale of sick birds can contaminate other birds at traders’ storage places and those at live bird markets. It also exposes consumers and traders, slaughterers and retailers to an increased risk of infection.”

Delabouglise noted that, on the flip side, a massive arrival of underage birds in a live bird market, or a price decrease due to the temporary oversupply of poultry, may be a sign that an outbreak is occurring.

“This is an interesting area for surveillance of livestock diseases,” he said.

Delabouglise said that the team’s results could help governmental agencies create policies that aim to avoid the spread of HPAI.

“Small-scale farmers could play an active role in the control of emerging infectious diseases if they are given the opportunity to depopulate their farm upon disease detection without disseminating pathogens in trade circuits,” he said. “Policymakers could encourage the establishment of formal trade agreements that encourage such ‘virtuous’ management of disease outbreaks in poultry.”

One such “virtuous” management strategy could be for farmers to sell their sick chickens as feed for pythons and crocodiles raised on neighboring farms. Another could be to set up agreements with neighboring large commercial farmers who can give them financial indemnities to destroy the birds as a way of protecting their own flocks.

“It would be impossible to have reliable public-health control over the millions of small-scale poultry flocks in a place like Vietnam,” said Delabouglise, “but providing economic incentives to responsibly manage birds during disease outbreaks is feasible.”

242,https://www.infowars.com/ancient-star-explosions-revealed-in-the-deep-sea/,2020-08-28T19:32:26,infowars,"A mystery surrounding the space around our solar system is unfolding thanks to evidence of supernovae found in deep-sea sediments.

Professor Anton Wallner, a nuclear physicist at ANU, led the study which shows the Earth has been traveling for the last 33,000 years through a cloud of faintly radioactive dust.

“These clouds could be remnants of previous supernova explosions, a powerful and super bright explosion of a star,” Professor Wallner said.

Professor Wallner conducted the research at the ANU Heavy Ion Accelerator Facility (HIAF). He also holds joint positions at the Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf (HZDR) and Technical University Dresden (TUD) in Germany.

The researchers searched through several deep-sea sediments from two different locations that date back 33,000 years using the extreme sensitivity of HIAF’s mass spectrometer. They found clear traces of the isotope iron-60, which is formed when stars die in supernova explosions.

Iron-60 is radioactive and completely decays away within 15 million years, which means any iron-60 found on the earth must have been formed much later than the rest of the 4.6-billion-year old earth and arrived here from nearby supernovae before settling on the ocean floor.

Professor Wallner previously found traces of iron-60 at about 2.6 million years ago, and possibly another at around 6 million years ago, suggesting earth had traveled through fallout clouds from nearby supernovae.

For the last few thousand years the solar system has been moving through a denser cloud of gas and dust, known as the local interstellar cloud, (LIC), whose origins are unclear. If this cloud had originated during the past few million years from a supernova, it would contain iron-60, and so the team decided to search more recent sediment to find out.

Sure enough, there was iron-60 in the sediment at extremely low levels—equating to radioactivity levels in space far below the Earth’s natural background levels—and the distribution of the iron-60 matched earth’s recent travel through the local interstellar cloud. But the iron-60 extended further back and was spread throughout the entire 33,000 year measurement period.

The lack of correlation with the solar system‘s time in the current local interstellar cloud seems to pose more questions than it answers. Firstly, if the cloud was not formed by a supernova, where did it come from? And secondly, why is there iron-60 so evenly spread throughout space?

“There are recent papers that suggest iron-60 trapped in dust particles might bounce around in the interstellar medium,” Professor Wallner said.

“So the iron-60 could originate from even older supernovae explosions, and what we measure is some kind of echo. More data is required to resolve these details.”

Scientists from ANU, the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organization, HZDR, the University of Vienna and the TU Berlin were involved in the study.

The findings have been published in the journal PNAS.

243,https://www.infowars.com/the-social-and-economic-side-effects-of-negative-interest-rates/,2020-08-28T19:24:43,infowars,"Our world is currently suffering from acute schizophrenia.

Banks are pushing impact and sustainable investing like crazy, companies are subordinating their production sites and supply chains to the noble goal of sustainability, and more and more parts of our society are discovering ecologism as the most meaningful political religion of our time.

At the same time—and this reveals the extent of the schizophrenia—our current economic structure is showing serious anomalies that are diametrically opposed to meaningful sustainability—first and foremost negative interest rates, which are increasingly eating into the structure of the economy and are turning the world upside down.

In a world of negative interest rates, the arrow of time runs backward. With negative interest rates, the present is more valuable than the future, the now seems more desirable than the tomorrow. The attraction of providing for the future is dwindling and with it the very care for the future. However, once the future is neglected, the very present degenerates into stagnation, throwing you back ever more.

Counterproductive Economic Activity

As a concrete consequence, negative interest rates promote rampant consumerism. Many people’s social propensity to consume tends to be exaggerated. Consumption is becoming a lifestyle. Not only is consumption happening more frequently, but also in greater quantities, not least because it is becoming less and less worthwhile to refrain from consumption, i.e. saving in the true sense of the word. People’s time preferences are completely distorted and hardly correspond to market interest rates.

If time preferences of market participants and interest rates on the market diverge, malinvestments and misallocation of capital are the logical result. The exaggerations are strongest at the two poles of the economic capital structure. Consumer-related and non-consumer-related areas are flourishing. The interim hype of the fidget spinners or the excess supply of hairdressing salons in small Swiss cities are examples of the former, while the construction boom that has been going on for years in Switzerland is an example of the latter.

Low to negative interest rates make previously unprofitable investments and projects suddenly appear profitable. At the same time, falling interest rates mean that later investors and companies can get into debt at “more favorable” interest rate conditions. The result: economic activity is fueled even more.

More intense competition among economic players, fired up by falling interest rates, is increasingly a strain on the latter. On the one hand, economic actors are facing intensifying competition that is squeezing margins. On the other hand, negative interest rates also have a capital-destroying effect, which consequently leads to deflationary tendencies—forces that once again nag at economic actors’ profitability. As a consequence, central banks are rushing to “rescue” companies from this real destruction of capital by making more and more liquidity available.

Only to fuel the fire that is already burning. While interest rates continue to come under pressure due to ongoing floods of liquidity, zombie companies are kept alive. Capital that has actually been used unprofitably is not released to be used and allocated by more solid companies. It remains in ailing corporate structures, which ultimately puts a strain on the overall economy. Competition is intensified to a degree that ultimately does not correspond to the preferences of market participants anymore. If their sovereignty as consumers, investors, and workers were not thwarted by the cheap money of the negative interest rate policy, these very resources would be released and zombie companies would be left to their actual fate.

From Risk-Free Interest to Interest-Free Risk

The existence of zombie companies ultimately affects the morale of employees within an economy. This very morale is likely to decrease especially in the environment of zombified economic structures. Thus, a growing proportion of zombie companies gives birth to more and more so-called bullshit jobs. These jobs are meaningless, as their existence is no longer geared to the preferences and wishes of market participants, and only exist because of liquidity injections, low interest rates, or politically mandated transfer payments.

Also, the real wages of workers are exposed to continuous devaluation in a negative interest rate environment. In particular, asset price inflation and the resulting decline in yield purchasing power over the years are more significant than many would suspect at first sight.

In view of these distortions, individual economic actors seem to find that economic processes quickly get out of hand. As their ability to make decisions and coordinate is undermined by ever more cheap liquidity, economic actors, especially if they see themselves as the losers of monetary policy and politics as a whole, feel powerless and frustrated. The economy is mentally impoverished, which is reflected in the consumption of more and more human capital in the form of burnout.

However, employees are not the only ones whose profession is made more difficult by negative interest rates. Even the work of the entrepreneur and investor becomes more and more difficult and burdensome with negative interest rates. The important instrument for discounting expected future investment returns is completely reduced to absurdity. If the interest rate is negative, cash values go into infinity and reasonable discounting becomes impossible. Entrepreneurs and investors are in the dark in their intertemporal planning. They make mistakes that they would otherwise be less likely to make.

Assets and goods of all kinds are wrongly priced and will inevitably be repriced again and again by the market. This implies shock-like volatility. Some might be able to profit from this volatility, but most will not, while more and more seem to be affected negatively by it.

Negative interest rates ultimately also cloud hopes of fundamental structural adjustments. They cement, indeed reward, the inability to learn and undermine the sustainable foundations of productivity. The economy and financial markets are increasingly becoming zombified constructs in which sustainability becomes a real farce and any meaning for individual economic actors is quickly lost. The monetary distortions and the economic distortions caused by them are mainly to the detriment of human mental states.

244,https://www.infowars.com/massive-stimulus-wont-prevent-a-eurozone-slowdown/,2020-08-28T19:21:41,infowars,"The European Central Bank balance sheet has risen to 53.9 percent of GDP in July 2020.

This compares to the 32 percent of the Federal Reserve and 33 percent of the Bank of England. This means a €1.78 trillion increase year to date. Furthermore, excess liquidity has soared to €2.9 trillion, a €1.2 trillion increase since January.

Added to this unprecedented monetary stimulus, the eurozone has included a record high 10 percent of GDP in various fiscal stimulus programs. None of it has prevented the economy from showing signs of slowing down in August.

After a strong bounce in May and June, coming from the reopening of most economies and the base effect, high frequency data compiled by Bloomberg Economics shows an evident slowdown in July and August. All economists who follow the eurozone economy are warning about the worrying weakening of leading indicators. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has also published its July 2020 Leading Indicator Index, which shows that economies like Spain are not just showing signs of weaker growth, but contraction. Italy continues to improve but at a slow pace, while France and Germany post declining growth levels.

The reason is evident. All the eurozone monster stimulus is focused on perpetuating bloated government budgets and incentivizing noneconomic return or subsidized spending. The entire European Recovery Fund is clearly aimed at promoting white elephants disguised as green projects, but what is more concerning is that the eurozone Green Deal includes more taxes and measures to prevent demand growth than productivity-enhancing plans.

This lesson should have been learnt in 2009. The European Union launched its massive Growth and Jobs Plan, which rose to more than 1.5 percent of the EU GDP, and the economy did not improve, while more than 4.5 million jobs were lost.

The problem of these massive stimuli is that they benefit the wrong parts of the economy. Multinationals and national champions that did not have any problem accessing markets in the past are taking advantage of current government spending in entitlements and subsidies and the massive private bond purchases and liquidity injections.

While the eurozone is raising “environmental” taxes on citizens and promoting subsidized spending in “the new green deal,” the biggest beneficiaries of the ECB corporate bond purchase program are large automotive companies, oil and gas multinationals, and big multiutilities. The ECB has bought bonds from Shell, Eni, Repsol, OMV, Total, Siemens, Daimler AG, BMW, Volkswagen, Renault, etc. None of these companies had any difficulty accessing capital markets or issuing debt at low rates, and their bonds could not be categorized as cheap in any way considering the yields and spreads. Most of these companies have established and mature businesses in sectors where overcapacity and margin challenges existed way before the previous and current crisis, so they will not increase hiring or capital spending due to the monetary stimulus.

Meanwhile, thousands of startups and small businesses with no access to credit because they have no hard assets are collapsing every month. The monster credit support coming from the transmission mechanism of monetary policy is hoarded by governments and multinationals. It is a massive incentive to overspend and malinvest. Governments feel happy adding more current spending and entitlements with no real economic return, and traditional multinationals that were in slowdown phase years ago are zombified by low rates.

The ECB and eurozone stimulus plans end up being massive subsidies to low productivity with collateral damage to high-productivity sectors in the form of higher taxes.

The reader may think that the same can be said about the United States and what the Federal Reserve does. Yes, to a certain extent. The main—and vital—difference is that the United States monetary policy transmission mechanism does not depend on the commercial bank channel. Less than 15 percent of the United States’s real economy is financed by the banking sector thanks to a diversified and flexible private credit system. In the eurozone it is more than 80 percent, similar to Japan.

This path to long-term stagnation should serve as a reminder for the United States, again, of why it is not advisable to follow the eurozone policies. The results are invariably disastrous.

A spokesman for the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) said on Friday that a US warship entered Chinese territorial waters without permission.

“We urge the US to stop such provocative behavior and restrict its maritime actions to avoid possible military accidents,” Senior Colonel Li Huamin said, adding that PLA naval and aerial forces monitored the vessel as it traveled through the South China Sea.

The US Navy said that the USS Martin carried out a “routine” operation in the region. Washington has cited the so-called “freedom of navigation” principle to defend its regular activity in the sea.

Earlier this week, China launched two missiles, including an “aircraft-carrier killer”, into the South China Sea after claiming that a U-2 spy plane had trespassed in a no-fly zone during live-fire military drills.

China’s foreign ministry said the presence of the US reconnaissance aircraft in the area was a “naked provocation” and could have caused an “unexpected accident.” The Pentagon denied any wrongdoing and condemned the missile launches as “counterproductive to easing tensions and maintaining stability.”

On Thursday, Beijing warned that its military “will not dance to the US’ tune” and urged Washington to rethink its confrontational approach to China and “pull itself out of the swamp of anxiety and paranoia.”

246,https://www.infowars.com/macron-sets-red-line-with-turkey-amid-mediterranean-row/,2020-08-28T19:03:49,infowars,"Earlier today, EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs Josep Borrell said after an informal summit of EU foreign ministers that Brussels may resort to industry sanctions against Ankara if talks on the drilling in disputed waters fail.

French President Emmanuel Macron has announced a tough stance concerning Turkey’s activities in the Mediterranean Sea, saying that Ankara only respects words backed by actions.

“When it comes to Mediterranean sovereignty, I have to be consistent in deeds and words. I can tell you that the Turks only consider and respect that. If you say words that are not followed by acts … What France did this summer was important: it’s a red line policy. I did it in Syria”, he told a news conference.

The statement comes after the EU threatened to impose sanctions against Ankara if the talks on drilling in disputed waters fail. Meanwhile, Ankara claims that the EU’s threats to impose sanctions only boost Turkey’s determination to continue the drilling. The Turkish Foreign Ministry has condemned the threats, saying that the EU has “no right to criticise and demand that Turkey terminate hydrocarbon exploration in its own territorial waters”.

Turkey’s drilling activities in the Eastern Mediterranean have long mired its relations both with Greece and Cyprus, which claim that Ankara has crossed into their exclusive economic zones, and the European Union, as the borders of those two countries are also the EU’s own external borders.

The Turkey-Greece tensions exacerbated over the past few weeks as Turkey intensified the exploration closer to the Greek border, ignoring the calls to vacant the disputed waters. Greece, in turn, mobilised its armed forces and warned it would stand up for its sovereignty by all available means, including military.

Jim Banks (R-IN) is introducing legislation this week, Breitbart News has learned, to strip convicted rioters of federal unemployment benefits and have them pay the cost of federal policing of riots.

Banks’ legislation, known as the Support Peaceful Protest Act, would ensure that rioters convicted of violence, vandalism, or looting must pay restitution to cover the cost of federal law enforcement policing of the riot at which they were arrested.

In addition, Banks’ plan would mandate that convicted rioters become ineligible for federal unemployment benefits during the Chinese coronavirus crisis. Some are currently receiving hundreds of dollars in extra unemployment benefits.

Gaige Grosskreutz, who was caught on camera pointing a gun at Rittenhouse before the teenager show him in the arm, made the comments after doctors were able to save the limb from being amputated.

According to his friend Jacob Marshall, who is pictured with Grosskreutz, the BLM supporter’s “only regret was not killing the kid and hesitating to pull the gun before emptying the entire mag into him.”

In the Facebook post, Marshall also admits that Grosskreutz “drew his weapon” before he was shot by Rittenhouse.

“Well this literally shows INTENT TO KILL, so Kyle Rittenhouse’s defense lawyer just got an early Christmas present,” tweeted Mike Cernovich.

Rittenhouse has excellent legal representation now that Lin Wood has agreed with Rittenhouse’s family to represent the 17-year-old.

Wood is famous for representing Covington Catholic High School student Nicholas Sandman, forcing CNN to settle for $275 million dollars after the network defamed Sandman over his confrontation with Native American activist Nathan Phillips in January 2019.

As we previously highlighted, footage from before the encounter shows that Rittenhouse did not shoot first and that he was being violently pursued by numerous BLM rioters.

The job cuts start next week, and represent about a quarter of all the company’s pre-pandemic US workforce of 68,000.

“Nothing pains me more than delivering news like this,” MGM’s CEO Bill Hornbuckle wrote in a tear-stained note to accompany the thousands of pinks lips. “The heart of this company is our employees and the world-class service you provide. Please know that your leadership team is working around the clock to find ways to grow our business and welcome back more of our colleagues,” Hornbuckle said.

“While the immediate future remains uncertain, I truly believe that the challenges we face today are not permanent.” Hornbuckle added “The fundamentals of our industry, our company and our communities will not change. Concerts, sports and awe-inspiring entertainment remain on our horizon.”

The company promised to extend health benefits for furloughed employees until September 30.

The “good news” is that MGM said it still plans to rehire those workers as business demand returns, and will maintain a recall list of former employees, and workers who return before the end of 2021 will retain seniority and immediately resume benefits, the company said. Health benefits for cut workers are being extended through Sept. 30.

“Federal law requires workers to be given a separation date if they’re furloughed for longer than six months. Aug. 31 marks six months of administrative separation for the furloughed MGM employees,” said CNBC.

MGM’s Empire City in New York state and Park MGM in Las Vegas remain closed, as casinos in Las Vegas are all operating at limited capacity with large declines in tourism and travel to the Las Vegas Strip. In June, Nevada casinos were allowed to reopen at half occupancy and MGM Resorts phased in casino reopenings over the following weeks.

Two of MGM’s 13 Strip resorts, Park MGM and the NoMad, are still closed, and MGM’s Mirage casino reopened this week. MGM Resorts reported a 91% drop in revenue for the three-month period that ended June 30, a similar decrease to other operators on the Strip.

In the footage, Rittenhouse offers first aid to a diverse group of protesters walking by and aids one of them who was shot with a rubber bullet by police.

“I am an EMT, if you are injured come to me,” Rittenhouse tells protesters.

Rittenhouse was likely one of the few trained EMT techs inside the riot zone given that police were simply keeping a perimeter around the rioting.

This video, showing Rittenhouse’s intent, further debunks mainstream reporters claiming Rittenhouse was a “white supremacist” who was targeting innocent protesters.

Rittenhouse was charged with six counts over the shootings, including “first-degree intentional homicide,” leading critics to suggest the charges were either straight-up political persecution or that they were intentionally overzealous to ensure they won’t stick while trying to appease rioters.

254,https://www.infowars.com/npr-claims-that-calling-a-riot-a-riot-is-racist/,2020-08-28T16:09:10,infowars,"NPR published an article claiming that calling a riot a “riot” is offensive because it’s “rooted in racism.”

Yes, really.

The article was written by Jonathan Levinson for Oregon Public Broadcasting, the Portland NPR affiliate.

Portland has experienced 93 days of continuous rioting – last night was the first time in that entire period that the city has not seen unrest – but according to Levinson, merely calling a spade a spade is a racist dog whistle.

Levinson’s argument for this position is vague to the point of being non-existent. He appears upset that police are able to declare a riot and use crowd control measures to disperse violent BLM mobs.

Calling a riot a riot could be rooted in racism, says reporter Jonathan Levinson for Oregon Public Broadcasting, the Portland NPR affiliate. pic.twitter.com/b2srvbEgM7 — Andy Ngô (@MrAndyNgo) August 27, 2020

His only point appears to be that because crowd control measures were also used in the 60s during the civil rights era, this means that using them today is racist, despite the fact that the clear majority of BLM protesters in Portland are white.

The media now seems to be taking three different approaches to the riots.

Claim that they are largely “peaceful,” as both CNN and CBS News did this week.

Claim that the riots aren’t even happening at all or are minimal, as CNN political analyst Kirsten Powers did.

Or as NPR has done, simply declare that anyone who dares use the words “riot” to describe the mayhem that has plagued American cities for the past 3 months is a despicable racist.

Unfortunately for Democrats, the polls suggest that all three of these methods aren’t working because the unrest is turning voters away from Joe Biden in droves.

Check out the full speech here:

Here’s a transcript, via NBC News.

Friends, delegates, and distinguished guests: I stand before you tonight honored by your support; proud of the extraordinary progress we have made together over the last four years; and brimming with confidence in the bright future we will build for America over the NEXT four years!

As we begin this evening, our thoughts are with the wonderful people who have just come through the wrath of Hurricane Laura. We are working closely with state and local officials in Texas, Louisiana, Arkansas, and Mississippi, sparing no effort to save lives. While the hurricane was fierce, one of the strongest to make landfall in 150 years, the casualties and damage were far less than thought possible only 24 hours ago. This is due to the great work of FEMA, law enforcement, and the individual states. I will be going this weekend. We are one national family, and we will always protect, love and care for each other.

Here tonight are the people who have made my journey possible, and filled my life with so much joy.

For her incredible service to our nation and its children, I want to thank our magnificent First Lady. I also want to thank my amazing daughter Ivanka for that introduction, and to all of my children and grandchildren – I love you more than words can express. I know my brother Robert is looking down on us right now from Heaven. He was a great brother and was very proud of the job we are doing. Let us also take a moment to show our profound appreciation for a man who has always fought by our side, and stood up for our values – a man of deep faith and steadfast conviction: Vice President Mike Pence. Mike is joined by his beloved wife, a teacher and military mom, Karen Pence.

My fellow Americans, tonight, with a heart full of gratitude and boundless optimism, I proudly accept this nomination for President of the United States.

The Republican Party, the party of Abraham Lincoln, goes forward united, determined, and ready to welcome millions of Democrats, Independents, and anyone who believes in the GREATNESS of America and the righteous heart of the American People.

In a new term as President, we will again build the greatest economy in history – quickly returning to full employment, soaring incomes, and RECORD prosperity! We will DEFEND AMERICA against all threats, and protect America against all dangers. We will LEAD AMERICA into new frontiers of ambition and discovery, and we will reach for new heights of national achievement. We will rekindle new faith in our values, new pride in our history, and a new spirit of unity that can ONLY be realized through love for our country. Because we understand that America is NOT a land cloaked in darkness, America is the torch that enlightens the entire world.

Gathered here at our beautiful and majestic White House – known all over the world as the People’s House – we cannot help but marvel at the miracle that is our Great American Story. This has been the home of larger-than-life figures like Teddy Roosevelt and Andrew Jackson who rallied Americans to bold visions of a bigger and brighter future. Within these walls lived tenacious generals like Presidents Grant and Eisenhower who led our soldiers in the cause of freedom. From these grounds, Thomas Jefferson sent Lewis and Clark on a daring expedition to cross a wild and uncharted continent. In the depths of a bloody Civil War, President Abraham Lincoln looked out these very windows upon a half-completed Washington Monument – and asked God, in His Providence, to save our union. Two weeks after Pearl Harbor, Franklin Delano Roosevelt welcomed Winston Churchill, and just inside, they set our people on a course to victory in the Second World War.

In recent months, our nation, and the entire planet, has been struck by a new and powerful invisible enemy. Like those brave Americans before us, we are meeting this challenge. We are delivering lifesaving therapies, and will produce a vaccine BEFORE the end of the year, or maybe even sooner! We will defeat THE VIRUS, end the pandemic, and emerge stronger than ever before.

What united generations past was an unshakable confidence in America’s destiny, and an unbreakable faith in the American People. They knew that our country is blessed by God, and has a special purpose in this world. It is that conviction that inspired the formation of our union, our westward expansion, the abolition of slavery, the passage of civil rights, the space program, and the overthrow of fascism, tyranny and communism.

This towering American spirit has prevailed over every challenge, and lifted us to the summit of human endeavor.

And yet, despite all of our greatness as a nation, everything we have achieved is now endangered. This is the most important election in the history of our country. At no time before have voters faced a clearer choice between two parties, two visions, two philosophies, or two agendas.

This election will decide whether we SAVE the American Dream, or whether we allow a socialist agenda to DEMOLISH our cherished destiny.

It will decide whether we rapidly create millions of high paying jobs, or whether we crush our industries and send millions of these jobs overseas, as has foolishly been done for many decades.

Your vote will decide whether we protect law abiding Americans, or whether we give free reign to violent anarchists, agitators, and criminals who threaten our citizens.

And this election will decide whether we will defend the American Way of Life, or whether we allow a radical movement to completely dismantle and destroy it.

At the Democrat National Convention, Joe Biden and his party repeatedly assailed America as a land of racial, economic, and social injustice. So tonight, I ask you a very simple question: How can the Democrat Party ask to lead our country when it spends so much time tearing down our country?

In the left’s backward view, they do not see America as the most free, just, and exceptional nation on earth. Instead, they see a wicked nation that must be punished for its sins.

Our opponents say that redemption for YOU can only come from giving power to THEM. This is a tired anthem spoken by every repressive movement throughout history.

But in this country, we don’t look to career politicians for salvation. In America, we don’t turn to government to restore our souls – we put our faith in Almighty God.

Joe Biden is not the savior of America’s soul – he is the destroyer of America’s Jobs, and if given the chance, he will be the destroyer of American Greatness.

For 47 years, Joe Biden took the donations of blue collar workers, gave them hugs and even kisses, and told them he felt their pain – and then he flew back to Washington and voted to ship their jobs to China and many other distant lands. Joe Biden spent his entire career outsourcing the dreams of American Workers, offshoring their jobs, opening their borders, and sending their sons and daughters to fight in endless foreign wars.

Four years ago, I ran for President because I could not watch this betrayal of our country any longer. I could not sit by as career politicians let other countries take advantage of us on trade, borders, foreign policy and national defense. Our NATO partners, as an example, were far behind in their defense payments. But at my strong urging, they agreed to pay $130 billion more a year. This will ultimately go to $400 billion. Secretary General Stoltenberg, who heads NATO, was amazed, and said that President Trump did what no one else was able to do.

From the moment I left my former life behind, and a good life it was, I have done nothing but fight for YOU.

I did what our political establishment never expected and could never forgive, breaking the cardinal rule of Washington Politics. I KEPT MY PROMISES.

Together, we have ended the rule of the failed political class – and they are desperate to get their power back by any means necessary. They are angry at me because instead of putting THEM FIRST, I put AMERICA FIRST!

Days after taking office, we shocked the Washington Establishment and withdrew from the last Administration’s job-killing Trans Pacific Partnership. I then approved the Keystone XL and Dakota Access Pipelines, ended the unfair and costly Paris Climate Accord, and secured, for the first time, American Energy Independence. We passed record-setting tax and regulation cuts, at a rate nobody had ever seen before. Within three short years, we built the strongest economy in the history of the world.

Washington insiders asked me NOT to stand up to China – they pleaded with me to let China continue stealing our jobs, ripping us off, and robbing our country blind. But I kept my word to the American People. We took the toughest, boldest, strongest, and hardest hitting action against China in American History.

They said that it would be impossible to terminate and replace NAFTA – but again, they were wrong. Earlier this year, I ended the NAFTA nightmare and signed the brand new U.S. Mexico Canada Agreement into law. Now auto companies and others are building their plants and factories in America, not firing their employees and deserting us.

In perhaps no area did the Washington special interests try harder to stop us than on my policy of pro-American immigration. But I refused to back down – and today America’s borders are more secure than EVER before. We ENDED catch-and-release, stopped asylum fraud, took down human traffickers who prey on women and children, and we have deported 20,000 Gang Members and 500,000 Criminal Aliens. We have already built 300 miles of Border Wall – and we are adding 10 new miles every single week. The Wall will soon be complete, and it is working beyond our wildest expectations.

We are joined this evening by members of the Border Patrol union, representing our country’s courageous border agents. Thank you all.

When I learned that the Tennessee Valley Authority laid off hundreds of American Workers and forced them to train their lower-paid foreign replacements, I promptly removed the Chairman of the Board. And now, those talented American Workers have been RE-HIRED and are back providing power to Georgia, Alabama, Tennessee, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, and Virginia. They have their old jobs back, and some are here with us this evening. Please stand.

Last month, I took on Big Pharma and signed orders that will massively lower the cost of your prescription drugs, and to give critically ill patients access to lifesaving cures, we passed the decades long-awaited RIGHT TO TRY legislation. We also passed VA Accountability and VA Choice.

By the end of my first term, we will have approved more than 300 federal judges, including two great new Supreme Court Justices. To bring prosperity to our forgotten inner cities, we worked hard to pass historic criminal justice reform, prison reform, opportunity zones, the long-term funding of historically black colleges and universities, and, before the China Virus came in, produced the best unemployment numbers for African-Americans, Hispanic-Americans, and Asian-Americans ever recorded. I have done more for the African-American community than any president since Abraham Lincoln, our first Republican president. I have done more in three years for the black community than Joe Biden has done in 47 years—and when I’m reelected, the best is yet to come!

When I took office, the Middle East was in total chaos. ISIS was rampaging, Iran was on the rise, and the war in Afghanistan had no end in sight. I withdrew from the terrible, one-sided Iran Nuclear Deal. Unlike many presidents before me, I kept my promise, recognized Israel’s true capital and moved our Embassy to Jerusalem. But not only did we talk about it as a future site, we got it built. Rather than spending $1 billion on a new building as planned, we took an already owned existing building in a better location, and opened it at a cost of less than $500,000. We also recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, and this month we achieved the first Middle East peace deal in 25 years. In addition, we obliterated 100 percent of the ISIS Caliphate, and killed its founder and leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. Then, in a separate operation, we eliminated the world’s number one terrorist, Qasem Soleimani.

Unlike previous administrations, I have kept America OUT of new wars – and our troops are coming home. We have spent nearly $2.5 trillion on completely rebuilding our military, which was very badly depleted when I took office. This includes three separate pay raises for our great warriors. We also launched the Space Force, the first new branch of the United States military since the Air Force was created almost 75 years ago.

We have spent the last four years reversing the damage Joe Biden inflicted over the last 47 years.

Biden’s record is a shameful roll call of the most catastrophic betrayals and blunders in our lifetime. He has spent his entire career on the wrong side of history. Biden voted for the NAFTA disaster, the single worst trade deal ever enacted; he supported China’s entry into the World Trade Organization, one of the greatest economic disasters of all time. After those Biden calamities, the United States lost 1 in 4 manufacturing jobs. The laid off workers in Michigan, Ohio, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, and many other states didn’t want Joe Biden’s hollow words of empathy, they wanted their jobs back!

As Vice President, he supported the Trans Pacific Partnership which would have been a death sentence for the U.S. Auto Industry; he backed the horrendous South Korea trade deal, which took many jobs from our country. He repeatedly supported mass amnesty for illegal immigrants. He voted FOR the Iraq War; he opposed the mission to take out Osama bin Laden; he opposed killing Soleimani; he oversaw the rise of ISIS, and cheered the rise of China as “a positive development” for America and the world. That’s why China supports Joe Biden and desperately wants him to win.

China would own our country if Joe Biden got elected. Unlike Biden, I will hold them fully accountable for the tragedy they caused.

In recent months, our nation, and the rest of the world, has been hit with a once-in-a-century pandemic that China allowed to spread around the globe. We are grateful to be joined tonight by several of our incredible nurses and first responders – please stand and accept our profound thanks. Many Americans have sadly lost friends and cherished loved ones to this horrible disease. As one nation, we mourn, we grieve, and we hold in our hearts forever the memories of all of those lives so tragically taken. In their honor, we will unite. In their memory, we will overcome.

When the China Virus hit, we launched the largest national mobilization since World War II. Invoking the Defense Production Act, we produced the world’s largest supply of ventilators. Not a single American who has needed a ventilator has been denied a ventilator. We shipped hundreds of millions of masks, gloves and gowns to our front line healthcare workers. To protect our nation’s seniors, we rushed supplies, testing kits, and personnel to nursing homes and long term care facilities. The Army Corps of Engineers built field hospitals, and the Navy deployed our great hospital ships.

We developed, from scratch, the largest and most advanced testing system in the world. America has tested more than every country in Europe put together, and more than every nation in the Western Hemisphere COMBINED. We have conducted 40 million more tests than the next closest nation.

We developed a wide array of effective treatments, including a powerful anti-body treatment known as Convalescent Plasma that will save thousands of lives. Thanks to advances we have pioneered, the fatality rate has been reduced by 80 percent since April.

The United States has among the lowest case fatality rates of any major country in the world. The European Union’s case fatality rate is nearly three times higher than ours. Altogether, the nations of Europe have experienced a 30 percent greater increase in excess mortality than the United States.

We enacted the largest package of financial relief in American history. Thanks to our Paycheck Protection Program, we have saved or supported more than 50 million American jobs. As a result, we have seen the smallest economic contraction of any major western nation, and we are recovering much faster. Over the past three months, we have gained over 9 million jobs, a new record.

Unfortunately, from the beginning, our opponents have shown themselves capable of nothing but a partisan ability to criticize. When I took bold action to issue a travel ban on China, Joe Biden called it hysterical and xenophobic. If we had listened to Joe, hundreds of thousands more Americans would have died.

Instead of following the science, Joe Biden wants to inflict a painful shutdown on the entire country. His shutdown would inflict unthinkable and lasting harm on our nation’s children, families, and citizens of all backgrounds.

The cost of the Biden shutdown would be measured in increased drug overdoses, depression, alcohol addiction, suicides, heart attacks, economic devastation and more. Joe Biden’s plan is not a solution to the virus, but rather a surrender.

My Administration has a different approach. To save as many lives as possible, we are focusing on the science, the facts and the data. We are aggressively sheltering those at highest risk – especially the elderly – while allowing lower-risk Americans to safely return to work and school.

Most importantly, we are marshalling America’s scientific genius to produce a vaccine in RECORD TIME. Under Operation Warp Speed, we have three different vaccines in the final stage of trials right now, years ahead of what has been achieved before. We are producing them in advance, so that hundreds of millions of doses will be quickly available.

We will have a safe and effective vaccine this year, and together we will crush the virus.

At the Democrat convention, you barely heard a word about their agenda. But that’s not because they don’t have one. It’s because their agenda is the most extreme set of proposals ever put forward by a major party nominee. Joe Biden may claim he is an “ally of the Light,” but when it comes to his agenda, Biden wants to keep you completely in the dark.

He has pledged a $4 trillion tax hike on almost all American families, which will totally collapse our rapidly improving economy and once again record stock markets. On the other hand, just as I did in my first term, I will cut taxes even further for hardworking moms and dads, not raise them. We will also provide tax credits to bring jobs out of China BACK to America – and we will impose tariffs on any company that leaves America to produce jobs overseas. We’ll make sure our companies and jobs stay in our country, as I’ve already been doing. Joe Biden’s agenda is Made in China. My agenda is MADE IN THE USA.

Biden has promised to abolish the production of American oil, coal, shale, and natural gas – laying waste to the economies of Pennsylvania, Ohio, Texas, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Colorado, and New Mexico. Millions of jobs will be lost, and energy prices will soar. These same policies led to crippling power outages in California just last week. How can Joe Biden claim to be an “ally of the Light” when his own party can’t even keep the lights on?

Joe Biden’s campaign has even published a 110-page policy platform co-authored with Far-Left Senator Bernie Sanders. The Biden-Bernie Manifesto calls for suspending ALL removals of illegal aliens, implementing nationwide Catch-and-Release; and providing illegal aliens with free taxpayer-funded lawyers. Joe Biden recently raised his hand on the debate stage and promised to give away YOUR healthcare dollars to illegal immigrants. He also supports deadly Sanctuary Cities that protect criminal aliens. He promised to end national security travel bans from Jihadist nations, and he pledged to increase refugee admissions by 700 percent. The Biden Plan would eliminate America’s borders in the middle of a global pandemic.

Biden also vowed to oppose School Choice and close down Charter Schools, ripping away the ladder of opportunity for Black and Hispanic children.

In a second term, I will EXPAND charter schools and provide SCHOOL CHOICE to every family in America. And we will always treat our teachers with the tremendous respect they deserve.

Joe Biden claims he has empathy for the vulnerable – yet the party he leads supports the extreme late-term abortion of defenseless babies right up to the moment of BIRTH. Democrat leaders talk about moral decency, but they have no problem with stopping a baby’s beating heart in the 9th month of pregnancy.

Democrat politicians refuse to protect innocent life, and then they lecture us about morality and saving America’s soul? Tonight, we proudly declare that all children, born and unborn, have a GOD-GIVEN RIGHT TO LIFE.

During the Democrat Convention, the words “Under God” were removed from the Pledge of Allegiance – not once, but twice. The fact is, this is where they are coming from.

If the left gains power, they will demolish the suburbs, confiscate your guns, and appoint justices who will wipe away your Second Amendment and other Constitutional freedoms.

Biden is a Trojan horse for socialism. If Joe Biden doesn’t have the strength to stand up to wild-eyed Marxists like Bernie Sanders and his fellow radicals, then how is he ever going to stand up FOR you?

The most dangerous aspect of the Biden Platform is the attack on public safety. The Biden-Bernie Manifesto calls for Abolishing cash bail, immediately releasing 400,000 criminals onto your streets and into your neighborhoods.

When asked if he supports cutting police funding, Joe Biden replied, “Yes, absolutely.” When Congresswoman Ilhan Omar called the Minneapolis police department a cancer that is “rotten to the root,” Biden wouldn’t disavow her support and reject her endorsement – he proudly displayed it on his website.

Make no mistake, if you give power to Joe Biden, the radical left will Defund Police Departments all across America. They will pass federal legislation to reduce law enforcement nationwide. They will make every city look like Democrat-run Portland, Oregon. No one will be safe in Biden’s America.

My administration will always stand with the men and women of law enforcement. Every day, police officers risk their lives to keep us safe, and every year, many sacrifice their lives in the line of duty.

One of these incredible Americans was Detective Miosotis Familia. She was part of a team of American Heroes called the NYPD or New York’s Finest. Three years ago on Fourth of July weekend, Detective Familia was on duty in her vehicle when she was ambushed just after midnight and murdered by a monster who hated her purely for wearing the badge.

Detective Familia was a single mom – she’d recently asked for the night shift so she could spend more time with her kids. Two years ago, I stood in front of the U.S. Capitol alongside those children, and held their Grandmother’s hand as they mourned their terrible loss and we honored Detective Familia’s extraordinary life.

Detective Familia’s three children are with us this evening. Genesis, Peter, and Delilah, we are so grateful to have you here tonight. I promise you that we will treasure your mom in our memories forever.

We must remember that the overwhelming majority of police officers in this country are noble, courageous and honorable. We have to give law enforcement, our police, back their power. They are afraid to act. They are afraid to lose their pension. They are afraid to lose their jobs, and by being afraid they are not able to do their jobs. And those who suffer most are the great people who they want so desperately to protect.

When there is police misconduct, the justice system must hold wrongdoers fully and completely accountable, and it will. But what we can never have in America – and must never allow – is MOB RULE. In the strongest possible terms, the Republican Party condemns the rioting, looting, arson and violence we have seen in Democrat-run cities like Kenosha, Minneapolis, Portland, Chicago, and New York.

There is violence and danger in the streets of many Democrat-run cities throughout America. This problem could easily be fixed if they wanted to. We must always have law and order. All federal crimes are being investigated, prosecuted, and punished to the fullest extent of the law.

When the anarchists started ripping down our statues and monuments, I signed an order, ten years in prison, and it all stopped.

During their convention, Joe Biden and his supporters remained completely silent about the rioters and criminals spreading mayhem in Democrat-Run Cities. In the face of left-wing anarchy and mayhem in Minneapolis, Chicago, and other cities, Joe Biden’s campaign did not condemn it – they DONATED to it. At least 13 members of Joe Biden’s campaign staff donated to a fund to bail out vandals, arsonists, looters, and rioters from jail.

Here tonight is the grieving family of retired police Captain David Dorn, a 38-year veteran of the St. Louis Police Department. In June, Captain Dorn was shot and killed as he tried to protect a store from rioters and looters. We are honored to be joined tonight by his wife Ann and beloved family members: Brian and Kielen. To each of you: we will never forget the heroic legacy of Captain David Dorn.

As long as I am President, I will defend the absolute right of every American citizen to live in security, dignity, and peace.

If the Democrat Party wants to stand with anarchists, agitators, rioters, looters, and flag-burners, that is up to them, but I, as your President, will not be a part of it. The Republican Party will remain the voice of the patriotic heroes who keep America Safe.

Last year, over 1,000 African-Americans were murdered as result of violent crime in just four Democrat-run cities. The top 10 most dangerous cities in the country are run by Democrats, and have been for decades. Thousands more African-Americans are victims of violent crime in these communities Joe Biden and the left ignore these American Victims. I NEVER WILL.

If the Radical Left takes power, they will apply their disastrous policies to every city, town, and suburb in America.

Just imagine if the so-called peaceful demonstrators in the streets were in charge of every lever of power in the U.S. Government.

Liberal politicians claim to be concerned about the strength of American institutions. But who, exactly, is attacking them? Who is hiring the radical professors, judges, and prosecutors? Who is trying to abolish immigration enforcement, and establish speech codes designed to muzzle dissent? In every case, the attacks on American institutions are being waged by the radical left.

Always Remember: they are coming after ME, because I am fighting for YOU.

We must reclaim our independence from the left’s repressive mandates. Americans are exhausted trying to keep up with the latest list of approved words and phrases, and the ever-more restrictive political decrees. Many things have a different name now, and the rules are constantly changing. The goal of cancel culture is to make decent Americans live in fear of being fired, expelled, shamed, humiliated, and driven from society as we know it. The far-left wants to coerce you into saying what you know to be FALSE, and scare you out of saying what you know to be TRUE.

But on November 3rd, you can send them a thundering message they will never forget!

Joe Biden is weak. He takes his marching orders from liberal hypocrites who drive their cities into the ground while fleeing far from the scene of the wreckage. These same liberals want to eliminate school choice, while they enroll their children in the finest private schools in the land. They want to open our borders while living in walled-off compounds and communities. They want to defund the police, while they have armed guards for themselves.

This November, we must turn the page FOREVER on this failed political class. The fact is, I’m here, and they’re not – and that’s because of YOU. Together, we will write the next chapter of the Great American Story.

Over the next four years, we will make America into the Manufacturing Superpower of the World. We will expand Opportunity Zones, bring home our medical supply chains, and we will end our reliance on China once and for all.

We will continue to reduce taxes and regulations at levels not seen before.

We will create 10 million jobs in the next 10 months.

We will hire MORE police, increase penalties for assaults on law enforcement, and surge federal prosecutors into high-crime communities.

We will BAN deadly Sanctuary Cities, and ensure that federal healthcare is protected for American Citizens – not illegal aliens.

We will have strong borders, strike down terrorists who threaten our people, and keep America OUT of endless and costly foreign wars.

We will appoint prosecutors, judges, and justices who believe in enforcing the LAW – not their own political agenda.

We will ensure equal justice for citizens of every race, religion, color and creed.

We will uphold your religious liberty, and defend your Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms.

We will protect Medicare and Social Security.

We will always, and very strongly, protect patients with pre-existing conditions, and that is a pledge from the entire Republican Party.

We will END surprise medical billing, require price transparency, and further reduce the cost of prescription drugs and health insurance premiums.

We will greatly expand energy development, continuing to remain number one in the world, and keep America Energy Independent.

We will win the race to 5G, and build the world’s best cyber and missile defense.

We will fully restore patriotic education to our schools, and always protect free speech on college campuses.

We will launch a new age of American Ambition in Space. America will land the first WOMAN on the moon – and the United States will be the first nation to plant its flag on Mars.

This is the unifying national agenda that will bring our country TOGETHER.

So tonight, I say again to all Americans: This is the most important election in the history of our country. There has never been such a difference between two parties, or two individuals, in ideology, philosophy, or vision than there is right now.

Our opponents believe that America is a depraved nation.

We want our sons and daughters to know the truth: America is the greatest and most exceptional nation in the history of the world!

Our country wasn’t built by cancel culture, speech codes, and soul-crushing conformity. We are NOT a nation of timid spirits. We are a nation of fierce, proud, and independent American Patriots.

We are a nation of pilgrims, pioneers, adventurers, explorers and trailblazers who refused to be tied down, held back, or reined in. Americans have steel in their spines, grit in their souls, and fire in their hearts. There is no one like us on earth.

I want every child in America to know that you are part of the most exciting and incredible adventure in human history. No matter where your family comes from, no matter your background, in America, ANYONE CAN RISE. With hard work, devotion, and drive, you can reach any goal and achieve every ambition.

Our American Ancestors sailed across the perilous ocean to build a new life on a new continent. They braved the freezing winters, crossed the raging rivers, scaled the rocky peaks, trekked the dangerous forests, and worked from dawn till dusk. These pioneers didn’t have money, they didn’t have fame– but they had each other. They loved their families, they loved their country, and they loved their God!

When opportunity beckoned, they picked up their Bibles, packed up their belongings, climbed into covered wagons, and set out West for the next adventure. Ranchers and miners, cowboys and sheriffs, farmers and settlers – they pressed on past the Mississippi to stake a claim in the Wild Frontier.

Legends were born – Wyatt Earp, Annie Oakley, Davy Crockett, and Buffalo Bill.

Americans built their beautiful homesteads on the Open Range. Soon they had churches and communities, then towns, and with time, great centers of industry and commerce. That is who they were. Americans build the future, we don’t tear down the past!

We are the nation that won a revolution, toppled tyranny and fascism, and delivered millions into freedom. We laid down the railroads, built the great ships, raised up the skyscrapers, revolutionized industry, and sparked a new age of scientific discovery. We set the trends in art and music, radio and film, sport and literature – and we did it all with style, confidence and flair. Because THAT is who we are.

Whenever our way of life was threatened, our heroes answered the call.

From Yorktown to Gettysburg, from Normandy to Iwo Jima, American Patriots raced into cannon blasts, bullets and bayonets to rescue American Liberty.

But America didn’t stop there. We looked into the sky and kept pressing onward. We built a 6 million pound rocket, and launched it thousands of miles into space. We did it so that two brave patriots could stand tall and salute our wondrous American flag planted on the face of the Moon.

For America, nothing is impossible.

Over the next four years, we will prove worthy of this magnificent legacy. We will reach stunning new heights. And we will show the world that, for America, no dream is beyond our reach.

Together, we are unstoppable. Together, we are unbeatable. Because together, we are the proud CITIZENS of the UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. And on November 3rd, we will make America safer, we will make America stronger, we will make America prouder, and we will make America GREATER than ever before! Thank you, God Bless You.

257,https://www.infowars.com/us-marshals-rescue-dozens-of-missing-children-in-georgia/,2020-08-28T15:09:48,infowars,"The US Marshals Service Missing Child Unit has rescued 26 children and confirmed the safety of an additional 13, while arresting nine people for child trafficking-related offenses in Atlanta and Macon, Georgia.

The children rescued were aged between three and 17 years old, and 15 were confirmed as victims of sex trafficking.

The massive sweep concluded the two-week-long Operation Not Forgotten, as officers cleared 26 arrest warrants in total, including charges for sex trafficking, parental kidnapping, registered sex offender violations, drugs and weapons possession, and custodial interference.

“The message to missing children and their families is that we will never stop looking for you,” said Director of the US Marshals Service (USMS) Donald Washington, who praised the success of the operation that aimed to recover “some of the most at-risk and challenging recovery cases in the area.”

Washington highlighted the particular concerns of law enforcement, both local and federal, about the potential for child sex trafficking, child exploitation, sexual abuse and physical abuse, in addition to medical or mental health conditions among some of the children.

When we track down fugitives, it’s a good feeling to know that we’re putting the bad guy behind bars. But that sense of accomplishment is nothing compared to finding a missing child,” said Darby Kirby, Chief of the Missing Child Unit.

The USMS helped recover 295 missing children in 2019 – 75 percent of the cases referred to it. It was granted the authority to recover missing children under the 2015 Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act, and it established the Missing Child Unit a year later. Since then, it has recovered more than 1,800 missing children.

More than 420,000 children are currently missing in the US, 91 percent of whom are believed to be at-risk runaways.

258,https://www.infowars.com/wearing-masks-not-enough-w-h-o-says/,2020-08-28T14:59:28,infowars,"Wearing masks alone is not enough to prevent the spread of coronavirus, the technical lead of the World Health Organization’s (WHO) emergency program has said, adding that people need to maintain a safe distance from others.

“We are seeing that people aren’t really adhering to the physical distancing anymore,” said Maria Van Kerkhove at a WHO press conference. ” Even if you’re wearing masks, you still need to try to do the physical distancing of at least 1 meter (3 feet) and even further if you can.”

The WHO has laid out a list of measures to curb the spread of transmission, including wearing masks, maintaining physical distancing, and washing hands regularly and thoroughly.

“So, it’s not just masks alone. It’s not just physical distancing alone. It’s not just hand cleaning alone. Do it all,” said Van Kerkhove.

Here’s the most important recent developments from around the world:

Germany

The federal and state governments have mandated a 14-day home quarantine for all those returning to Germany from high-risk areas. President of the German Medical Association Klaus Reinhardt has proposed that these travelers should be monitored by the police during their quarantine.

The president of an association of pediatricians in Germany called for masks to be made mandatory for teachers in classrooms saying that it is not possible to maintain a safe distance in cramped classrooms.

In the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia, wearing masks in classes will no longer be mandatory for students at secondary schools from August 31. It will, however, still be compulsory in the school building outside classrooms.

Europe

The WHO’s top official in Europe warned that the rise of infections among young people may spread to older people, leading to an increase in the number of deaths.

Europe has seen a rise in infections in the summer holiday season. The UN agency issued guidelines for hotels and related businesses, asking them to reduce occupancy rates to ensure social distancing. It also said that staff and guests should comply with the basic prevention measures.

In Paris, wearing a mask outdoors has been made obligatory throughout the city — with an exception for those who are doing physical activity such as jogging or cycling. The new rule came into effect on Friday morning and includes a fine of €135 euros ($160) for non-compliance.

Italy’s daily infections rose again on Thursday, with many of the new cases being travelers returning from countries deemed high-risk.

Asia

South Korea has reported over 200 new cases for the third consecutive day. The country has seen a triple-digit rise in infection for the past 15 days. With 441 new cases on Thursday, it saw the biggest daily increase since March 7.

The Korea Center for Disease Control and Prevention said most of the new cases are in the densely populated Seoul metropolitan region.

Speaking to reporters Friday in Tokyo, Abe said he has decided to step down from the post since he is suffering from a recurrence of ulcerative colitis that ended his first term in office in 2007.

Abe, whose term would have ended in September 2021, is expected to stay on until a new party leader, who will serve as prime minister, is elected and approved by the parliament.

Speculation about Abe’s resignation emerged earlier this year after visits to a Tokyo hospital for health checkups. No details were made public at the time.

The 65-year-old Abe had acknowledged suffering ulcerative colitis since he was a teenager, and said he was undergoing treatment for the condition.

On Monday, Abe became Japan’s longest-serving prime minister by breaking the record of his great-uncle, Eisaku Sato, who served 2,798 days from 1964-72.

Tokyo’s benchmark Nikkei index closed down 1.5% on Friday after reports of Abe’s intentions.

261,https://www.infowars.com/cnn-political-analyst-claims-theres-very-little-rioting/,2020-08-28T12:11:38,infowars,"CNN political analyst Kirsten Powers reacted to President Trump’s RNC speech last night by absurdly claiming “there’s very little rioting.”

Yes, really.

“Let’s be honest Don and you do make this point over and over,” said Powers, addressing host Don Lemon.

“There’s very little rioting, actually there’s very little violence, but it’s magnified by Donald Trump and it’s magnified by Republicans to convince people that people are coming for them and that’s just simply not what’s happening,” said Powers.

In reality, as anyone with eyes would know, the last three months have seen relentless rioting and violence in numerous American cities on a nightly basis.

As an illustration, last night was the first time there hasn’t been a riot in Portland in a full 93 days.

It looks like there was no late-night violent protest or riot in Portland for the first time in 93 days. Something is off. Antifa wouldn't just stop. Could it because they're terrified after hearing that @FBIPortland is stepping up its investigations? pic.twitter.com/q11wemPtPH — Andy Ngô (@MrAndyNgo) August 28, 2020

In addition to hundreds or even thousands of injuries suffered by both police and rioters, there have been dozens of deaths during the George Floyd riots (Wikipedia used to publish a regularly updated death toll but this was removed in recent weeks).

Even back in June, the cost from property damage from the George Floyd riots (there have been many more since) were estimated to be the “most expensive civil disturbance(s) in US history,” according to experts, a figure that runs into the billions.

Multiple videos also emerge every day showing anyone who gets in the way of the rioters or tries to defend their property being viciously beaten, or in the case of David Dorn, killed in cold blood.

It’s no surprise that CNN is burying the true extent of the riots given that their reporters are still describing them as “mostly peaceful” while towns and cities literally burn behind them.

The left’s effort to bury how widespread the riots really are is also predicated on the fact that polls and anecdotal evidence both clearly suggests the unrest is turning voters away from Joe Biden.

The incident occurred on Tuesday night near East Alameda Avenue and South Sable Boulevard when 30-year-old Steve Sinclair approached 29-year-old Michael Conner and told him, “I’m going to kill you and your dog.”

Conner tried to run away and defend himself with a stick.

“An arrest affidavit says Sinclair used a knife to stab 29-year-old Michael Conner who was transported to the hospital for his injuries and a collapsed lung,” reports 9News.

“Conner, a white male, told police while at the hospital that Sinclair, a Black male, shouted “Black lives matter!” prior to stabbing him, according to the report.”

After police arrived, Sinclair continued yelling “black lives matter” while also telling officers “I stabbed him, I’m a psychopath,” before refusing to sit down and insisting that officers shoot him.

Sinclair is being held at Arapahoe County Jail and faces charges of first-degree murder and bias-motivated crime.

We have highlighted several other attacks in recent weeks that were apparently motivated by Black Lives Matter rhetoric.

Numerous vicious assaults have occurred at BLM protests, including in Kenosha, Wisconsin on Monday night when an elderly man was brutally assaulted after trying to protect his property from looters.

Another man in Portland was kicked in the head and knocked unconscious after trying to protect a person from being robbed.

Earlier this week, a gang of three men fired shots from their vehicle at a group of Trump supporters during a political rally in Charlotte.

Last week, a former city councilman who had a Trump/Pence sign in his yard was murdered in his home, although police claimed the killing was “random.”

263,https://www.infowars.com/linguists-young-people-refusing-to-use-full-stops-in-sentences-because-they-see-them-as-aggressive/,2020-08-28T10:40:17,infowars,"The world’s leading language experts have noted that young people are ‘fundamentally’ altering written communication based on what they perceive to be aggressive or offensive.

In particular, the use of the full stop, or period, in sentences is diminishing according to linguists because it has come to signify annoyance or offence.

“Full stops are, in my experience, very much the exception and not the norm in [young people’s] instant messages, and have a new role in signifying an abrupt or angry tone of voice,” notes Owen McArdle, a linguist at the ­University of Cambridge.

Fellow linguist Dr Lauren Fonteyn of Leiden University said “If you send a text message without a full stop, it’s already obvious that you’ve concluded the message. So if you add that additional marker for completion, they will read something into it and it tends to be a falling intonation or negative tone.”



Math? Whatever. It’s a sine of things to come. TikTok girl’s thoughts on math prove the theory that civilization is already dead. From British Museum to Mr. Bean, what made us civilized is being torn down (and we’re not talking about statues).

Professor David Crystal says that the period is perceived as “ominous” by younger people, particularly because the use of text messaging means that the end of sentences are becoming a thing of the past. Each one now has its own text message.

The professor claims that the full stop is no longer the end of a sentence, but is now an “emotion marker.”

“You look at the internet or any instant messaging exchange – anything that is a fast dialogue taking place. People simply do not put full stops in, unless they want to make a point.” Crystal noted in his 2015 book Making a Point.

Crystal points to a 2015 Binghamton University study that found college students perceive text messages ending in a full stop as being “less sincere” than those missing one.

During the same study, researchers discovered that exclamation points had the opposite effect, making people seem more ‘sincere and engaged’.

Research leader Celia Klin noted in 2015 that “When speaking, people easily convey social and emotional information with eye gaze, facial expressions, tone of voice, pauses and so on. People obviously can’t use these mechanisms when they are texting. Thus, it makes sense that texters rely on what they have available to them – emoticons, deliberate misspellings that mimic speech sounds and, according to our data, punctuation.”

The gradual erosion of Language was predicted by George Orwell in his classic dystopia 1984.

In the novel, the all powerful Party mandates Newspeak, which focuses on diminishing vocabulary in order to control the range of thought among the general population.

“The Washington Post is blatantly interfering with the business relationships of the Trump Organization, and it must stop,” said Deputy White House press secretary Judd Deere.

“Please be advised that we are building up a very large ‘dossier’ on the many false David Fahrenthold and others stories as they are a disgrace to journalism and the American people,” Deere added, referring to the Post reporter.

The story claims that federal agencies have racked up bills totalling almost $1 million at Trump Organization properties since President Trump took office.



Nancy Pelosi admits Joe Biden is no match for President Trump in upcoming debates.

The report also claims that the Trump properties repeatedly charged the Secret Service for “resort” and “furniture removal” fees, as well as doing deals with government agencies to block book rooms for a fortnight at a time, in case Trump needed to travel.

The insinuation in the report is that Trump is using his Presidency to line his pockets by staying at his own hotels and hosting Republican events there.

Deere told the Post that the claim is nonsense and that Trump “turned over the day-to-day responsibilities of running the company though he was not required to, [and] has sacrificed billions of dollars” by concentrating on his Presidency rather than his business interests.

“Joe Biden and his supporters remained completely silent about the rioters and criminals spreading mayhem in Democrat-run cities. They never even mentioned it during their entire convention,” Trump urged.

“Now, they’re starting to mention it because their poll numbers are going down like a rock in water,” Trump proclaimed, adding “Too late, Joe.”

Trump continued to slam Democrats’ support of black lives matter agitators, noting that “Joe Biden’s campaign did not condemn it; they donated to it,” citing Biden campaign staff’s donations to the Minnesota Freedom Fund, which was responsible for bailing out arrested rioters.

“At least 13 members of Joe Biden’s campaign staff donated to a fund to bail out vandals, arsonists, anarchists, looters, and rioters from jail,” Trump declared.

The President also addressed the tragic death of retired police Captain David Dorn, who was shot and killed during some of the first riots in St. Louis.

Dorn, who was attempting to fend off looters, was represented at the RNC by his wife, Ann.

“To each of you: we will never forget the heroic legacy of Captain David Dorn,” Trump said.

After avoiding directly addressing rioting in Democratic cities for months, Biden has attempted to turn it around and blame Trump for the unrest, with the leftist media following dutifully in line.

In a CNN interview yesterday, Biden claimed that Trump is “absolutely” rooting for violence on the streets of America.

“He views this as a political benefit to him. He’s rooting for more violence,” Biden later told MSNBC. “He’s encouraging this. He’s not diminishing it at all. This is his America now.”

The leftist media quickly began to repeat ad nauseam the talking point that Trump wants the violence to continue, and that this is ‘Trump’s America’:

As usual, this all likely comes too late for Democrats who actually had a chance of winning the election a few months back, but by supporting violent rioters have put Trump firmly in the driving seat:

“The Biden Plan would eliminate America’s borders in the middle of a global pandemic … they want to open our borders while living in walled-off compounds and communities,” Trump said.

“When I took bold action to issue a travel ban on China, Joe Biden called it hysterical and xenophobic,” Trump said. “If we had listened to Joe, hundreds of thousands more Americans would have died.”

Biden has vowed to end deportations of criminal illegal aliens on day one of his administration and has long opposed Trump’s travel bans on China to stop the spread of the coronavirus. Biden has since said he supports a travel ban, though his plan to handle the coronavirus does not include travel bans on China, Brazil, Europe, or Iran.

Rittenhouse was officially charged on Thursday with first-degree intentional homicide, first-degree reckless homicide, two counts of first-degree recklessly endangering safety, attempted first-degree intentional homicide and possession of a dangerous weapon by a person under 18 and is facing life in prison.

As Reuters reports:

The 17-year-old accused of killing two people during protests in Kenosha, Wisconsin, has hired a law firm whose clients have included President Donald Trump’s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani and former Trump adviser Carter Page.

Owen breaks down the possibility that Kyle Rittenhouse may not have been the shooter of one of the assumed victims. John Pierce told Reuters on Thursday that he and colleagues at Pierce Bainbridge would obtain justice for Kyle Rittenhouse, of Illinois, arrested and charged with shooting three people on Tuesday night, two of whom died. A civil litigator, Pierce tweeted on Thursday that he would soon be joined by “a SEAL Team” of former assistant U.S. attorneys who are now criminal defense attorneys. Pierce will appear with Rittenhouse at an extradition hearing in Lake County Circuit Court in Illinois on Friday. […] The Pierce Bainbridge firm bills itself as a “state-of-the-art litigation law firm dedicated to the lost art of combat by trial,” according to its website. Pierce told Reuters he is hoping to raise funds for Rittenhouse’s defense through his #FightBack Foundation, Inc., a Texas non-profit he formed with L. Lin Wood, an Atlanta attorney who is representing high school student Nicholas Sandmann.

As Michelle Malkin noted on Thursday, the deck is being stacked against young Kyle Rittenhouse.

Nonetheless, Lin Wood said on Thursday after teaming up with John Pierce that “Kyle will have excellent legal representation.”

Pierce said he will handle Rittenhouse’s defense with a team of the “best lawyers in [the] USA.”

Lin Wood and Pierce launched the #FightBack Foundation together on Thursday to raise funds for Rittenhouse’s legal defense.

It was revealed early Thursday that all three assailants who attacked Rittenhouse have criminal records and his first attacker was a level 3 sex offender (meaning a high-risk of reoffense and danger to the community) who was sentenced to over 12 years in prison for a sex crime involving a minor.

271,https://www.infowars.com/things-have-gotten-so-bad-that-a-million-new-claims-for-unemployment-benefits-in-one-week-is-considered-good-news/,2020-08-28T07:33:56,infowars,"The Labor Department announced on Thursday that another 1.006 million Americans filed new claims for unemployment benefits last week.

Prior to this year, the all-time record for a single week was just 695,000, and so the number of Americans that are losing their jobs each week continues to remain at a catastrophic level.

But this latest figure is actually being spun as “good news” because at least it was lower than the week before.



Owen Shroyer and Ali Alexander describe what Police reform entails and what liberals don’t know about it.

And I am willing to concede that point, because we should definitely welcome any sign that the numbers are starting to move in the right direction.

However, there is no doubt that what we have experienced up to this point in 2020 is nothing short of an economic cataclysm.

Over the last 23 weeks, more than 58 million Americans have filed new claims for unemployment benefits.

Even if zero workers filed for unemployment for the rest of 2020, this would still be the worst year for unemployment claims in all of U.S. history by a gigantic margin.

Vast hordes of workers have been losing their jobs week after week as the U.S. economy melts down right in front of our eyes.

This has truly been an economic horror show, and the most nightmarish chapters are still ahead of us.

When economic numbers start getting really bad, the government often decides to “modify” how they are calculated, and on Thursday the Labor Department announced that it will be “changing how it adjusts weekly jobless-claims figures for seasonal swings”.

Presumably, that should help the numbers look a bit better starting next week.

But no matter how much they massage the numbers, they can’t erase the fact that tens of millions of people are deeply hurting right now. According to one new survey, 61 percent of Americans need “another relief bill”, and about two-thirds of Americans from the age of 24 to the age of 54 say that they are currently in financial distress…

The latest survey by MagnifyMoney reveals 61 percent of the country needs another relief bill to pay for expenses. Over 80 percent of workers who have been laid off or furloughed due to COVID-19 are counting on more assistance. The poll of 1,010 Americans adds 71 percent of Generation X (ages 40 to 54) and 65 percent of millennials (ages 24 to 39) say they are currently in financial distress.

If you are not in financial distress at this moment, you should be very thankful for your blessings, because you are definitely in the minority.

And more layoff announcements just keep on coming with each passing day. On Thursday, we learned that Lord & Taylor will be laying off all their workers and closing every single store…

Lord & Taylor, the first department store established in the United States, is officially going out of business, ending a nearly 200-year run. The bankrupt company announced Thursday that all of its 38 remaining stores and website have begun liquidation sales — a reversal from last week’s decision to keep 14 locations open.

When I was a kid, I was always so intimidated by Lord & Taylor when my mother would take me to the mall.

I always thought that was where the rich people shopped.

I never imagined that someday I would see it go out of business forever.

Of course countless other retailers are going belly up as the worst “retail apocalypse” in U.S. history rolls on. According to Coresight Research, approximately 25 percent of all malls in the United States “will close over the next three to five years”…

Another new report out this week from Coresight Research estimates 25% of America’s roughly 1,000 malls will close over the next three to five years, with the pandemic accelerating a demise that was already underway before the new virus emerged.

Can you imagine what our country is going to look like if that actually happens?

Already, communities all over America are being blighted by one boarded up property after another, and this is especially true in many impoverished areas.

Of course our economic problems have been accelerated by a series of very unusual events that have been beyond our control. It has been one thing after another here in 2020, and the latest major disaster to hit us was Hurricane Laura. We were extremely fortunate that neither New Orleans or Houston took a direct hit from this storm, because it was enormously destructive. Just consider what one survivor told the press about the devastation in his community…

“It looks like 1,000 tornadoes went through here. It’s just destruction everywhere,” said Brett Geymann, who rode out the storm with three family members in Moss Bluff, near Lake Charles, Louisiana. He described Laura passing over his house with the roar of a jet engine around 2 a.m.

Let us hope that we will have at least a little bit of time before the next major crisis comes along. Many had been hoping that August would be a quiet month, but that didn’t turn out to be the case, and now September is just a few days away.

And as we approach the fall season, it is being reported that wealthy investors have been “hoarding cash”…

A group of multimillionaire investors in the U.S. are hoarding cash at unprecedented levels. Tiger 21, a club of more than 800 investors, reported Thursday that its members have raised their cash holdings to 19% of their total assets on concerns over the economic consequences of the covid pandemic in the U.S. That’s up from about 12% since the start of the outbreak. About a quarter now expect the crisis to continue until the end of next June, the group said.

Is this a sign that many of them believe that trouble is ahead for the financial markets?

Of course it isn’t just the wealthy that are deeply concerned about the months ahead. Our nation has been gripped by endless turmoil for most of this year, and now a very hotly contested presidential election is just over two months away. Meanwhile, economic conditions will continue to deteriorate, and that means that tens of millions of Americans will become even more angry and even more frustrated. If you believe that the U.S. is just going to snap out of all of this somehow and everything will turn out just fine in the end, then you simply do not understand the times in which we are living.

For so long we were warned that a “perfect storm” was coming, and now it is here.

And if you think that 2020 has been bad, just wait until you see what else is ahead.

Several other charges are pending, according to the Kenosha County DA.

The suspects were driving three vehicles; a black school bus, a bread truck and a tan minivan.

Police said this began with a citizen tip that the vehicles planned to meet in a remote lot near State Highway 50 and Green Bay Road, Officers began surveilling the vehicles after locating them, assisted by U.S. Marshals — and confirmed the out-of-state plates. Police said officers followed them to a gas station near Washington Road and 30th Avenue, where officers observed the occupants of the bus and bread truck exit and attempt to fill multiple fuel cans . –Fox29

Understandably, officers then suspected “that the occupants of these vehicles were preparing for criminal activity related to the civil unrest,” after which they attempted to make contact and investigate the incident.

The police noted that “the officers exited their vehicles, identified themselves, were wearing appropriate identification and then detained the occupants of the bus and bread truck.”

As officers closed in, the driver of the minivan attempted to pull away, but was stopped by police who forced an entry into the vehicle and arrested the occupants.

The vehicles contained helmets, gas masks, protective vests, illegal fireworks and suspected controlled substances, according to the report.

277,https://www.infowars.com/w-h-o-skips-wuhan-during-china-trip-sat-in-beijing-for-three-weeks/,2020-08-27T21:09:22,infowars,"A delegation from the World Health Organization tasked with investigating the origins of COVID-19 failed to go to Wuhan, China – ‘ground zero’ for the pandemic, and instead “sat in Beijing for three weeks” according to a senior US official, who told the Financial Times that Western governments are skeptical over China’s commitment to identifying the origins of the pandemic.

“Any chance of finding a smoking gun is now gone,” the official continued. Though we’re not sure what any team of investigators would find after China blocked international epidemiologists for eight months after the outbreak began.

Australian MP Dave Sharma told the Times: “The international community is right to have serious concerns about the rigour and independence of the WHO’s early response to this pandemic, and its seeming wish to avoid offending China.

“If this allegation is proven, it is another disturbing incident of the WHO — which is charged with safeguarding global public health — putting the political sensitivities of a member state above the public health interests of the world, in the critical early stages of this pandemic. We are all now bearing the immense costs of such a policy.”

The WHO, meanwhile, says that the three-week visit was ‘merely laying the groundwork in advance of a full international mission,’ but gave no indication when this might happen.

After initially bristling at calls from Australia, the US and other countries for a probe into the outbreak, which has claimed more than 800,000 lives, Chinese president Xi Jinping in May endorsed a WHO-led inquiry.

But the WHO resolution “to identify the zoonotic source of the virus and the route of introduction to the human population” — which was backed by more than 130 countries — has been dogged by concerns over transparency and access. –Financial Times

“A two-person WHO team has recently concluded its three-week assignment in China to lay the groundwork for an investigation into the source of the virus. This was in advance of the full mission, therefore, there are no ‘results of the WHO’s recent mission’ to share.”” said the UN agency in a statement last week.

Backing the WHO was China’s foreign ministry, which said on Wednesday that questions over the legitimacy of the WHO inquiry were “totally unjustified,” and that China had acted responsibly by inviting the WHO during a “critical period” of trying to prevent a resurgence of the virus.”

“We hope all relevant countries . . . can be like China to adopt a positive attitude and work together with the WHO,” they added.

Anyone buying this?

US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo predicted in July that the WHO inquiry would be “completely whitewashed,” while President Trump – who terminated US ties with the WHO in May, said the organization was under Beijing’s “total control.”

Even a Council on Foreign Relations senior fellow for global health, Huang Yanzhong, said the investigation would require unrestricted access to Wuhan, along with other parts of China – such as the southwestern Yunnan province, in order to conclude anything.

“It would be unrealistic to expect that the inquiry would be a purely scientific endeavour,” he said, adding that the WHO might focus purely on the animal origin theory of the virus rather than a lab accident.

“In response to questions from the FT this week, the WHO said its advance team had remote conversations with senior scientists from the Wuhan Institute of Virology. It agreed with China that preliminary epidemiological studies around the Wuhan market and the first cluster of cases would be conducted in the coming weeks and months.

“The international team will work with Chinese researchers to support these studies initially remotely, and later locally. The exact timing will depend on the advance and preliminary results of the initial studies,” the organisation said.” –Financial Times

Mainstream scientists, particularly those from China, maintain that Sars-Cov-2, the virus which causes COVID-19, originated from horseshoe bats in the southwest region of the country, which were found to carry a coronavirus that is a 96% genetic match.

What most scientists won’t consider, is that the virus could have been cultured by a team of coronavirus experts operating out of Wuhan, who were criticized in 2015 for ‘gain-of-function’ experiments to give bat coronavirus the ability to infect humans.

Sometimes the simplest explanation makes you a conspiracy theorist.

With the quick response, the classroom co-caregiver informed me of the inappropriate behavior of the other caregiver.”

“I terminated the employee immediately and consequently not allowed her to reenter the center. In reviewing the classroom monitoring video, it was evident the severity of the situation. Therefore, I followed protocol to notify DSS, OHAN, local law enforcement and parents.”

Rescue efforts were launched in the Mediterranean Sea by the Hellenic Coast Guard after authorities received distress calls from a boat taking water on Tuesday night, the Greek City Times reports.

“Ninety-six people have been rescued so far and 77 have been transferred to Karpathos and Rhodes islands, while 19 were collected by Turkish Coast Guard vessels,” spokesman Nikos Lagadianos said on Wednesday.

The massive search-and-rescue operation took place at night and reportedly entailed two military helicopters, five local vessels, a navy ship, and five coast guard boats in one of the ""largest and most successful"" missions of its kind in the Aegean Sea.

At least four foreign nationals have been arrested under suspicion of human smuggling following the incident.

Meanwhile, 121 migrants have been moved from camps in Greece to Germany, including 28 children requiring special medical attention and their relatives.

“The transfer was part of a wider European effort to get hundreds of vulnerable children out of camps on the Greek islands. Two previous transfers of ailing children to Germany took place in July,” the Associated Press reports.

“Germany has agreed to take in a total of 243 children ‘who need medical treatment’ from Greece, as well their closest relatives, 928 people in all. So far, 68 of the children have arrived.”

The migrants were transported via plane following a delayed Aug. 13 transfer date due to positive coronavirus tests among some of the candidates.

On Thursday, Urlacher made a post that mocked NBA players who threatened to boycott the remainder of the season – which has received terrible ratings and been trounced in primetime by cable news host Tucker Carlson – in solidarity with felon Jacob Blake, who was shot by police after resisting arrest and attempting to get into his vehicle, where a knife lay on the floor.

“Brett Favre played the MNF game the day his dad died, threw four TDs in the first half, and was a legend for playing in the face of adversity,” Urlacher’s post read.

“NBA players boycott the playoffs because a dude reaching for a knife, wanted on a felony sexual assault warrant, was shot by police.”

Urlacher also liked a post in support of 17-year-old Kyle Rittenhouse, who has been charged with first degree homicide after reportedly shooting three Black Lives Matter rioters who attacked him amidst ongoing looting and arson in Kenosha, Wisconsin.

Public displays of support for Rittenhouse, despite the video evidence that indicates he acted in self defense, have repeatedly not been treated as free speech by media and big tech platforms.

On Wednesday, fundraising platform GoFundMe banned a donation page for Rittenhouse’s legal defense fund, while allowing pages asking for bail money for criminals arrested during Black Lives Matter riots to rake in millions in cash donations.

Simultaneously, GoFundMe promoted an account raising money for one of the deceased protesters who attacked Rittenhouse, describing him as a “hero” who “gave his life” trying to “save others.”

About 40 crewmembers were swimming in the Pacific Ocean earlier this week when the predator was spotted, prompting ME1 Samuel Cintron, who was on “shark duty,” to begin shooting.

A Facebook post by the U.S. Coast Guard Cutter Kimball stated, “Our animal-lover Chief who wants to save every animal she finds yelled ‘Shoot it!’ ME1 Cintron fired a well-aimed burst right at/on top of the shark to protect shipmates just feet away. It turned away for a few seconds then turned back.”

“ME1 fired bursts as needed to keep the shark from his shipmates with amazing accuracy. The shark would wave off with each burst but kept coming back toward our shipmates,” the post explained.

Cintron discussed the incident during Thursday’s “Good Morning America” broadcast.

“I wasn’t willing to risk the lives of my shipmates. I made the call,” he said.

The shark didn’t appear to have been injured and swam away with another group of sharks.

According to local CBS affiliate WBTV, the mural, which is being referred to as “vandalism,” was spotted by the news team during an aerial shot Wednesday, after which they alerted authorities.

The vandalism is being investigated by the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department. https://t.co/lIFKhgpdIQ — WDBJ7 (@WDBJ7) August 27, 2020

More from WBTV:

WBTV’s Sky 3 observed the mural from above. WBTV reached out to the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department to see if there was any response to this mural.

They responded and said on Wednesday, CMPD officers went to South Torrence Street in reference to a call for service regarding vandalism in the street.

Interesting to note that while the mural is similar to ones celebrating “Black Lives Matter” in major Democrat-run cities across the country, the message promoting life is instead being investigated as an act of vandalism.

So it’s vandalism when it doesn’t meet your narrative? — NEAL 🇺🇸 (@NealThomp) August 27, 2020

“So it’s vandalism when it doesn’t meet your narrative?” noted one keen Twitter user.

The “Baby Lives Matter” message riffs off the Black Lives Matter mantra to call attention to the millions of babies killed in abortion clinics each year.

In this case, the message takes on special significance as it’s painted outside Planned Parenthood, the abortion provider credited with killing millions of black babies that’s finally having to face the “racist legacy” and “eugenic ideology” of its founder, Margaret Sanger.

The Pentagon has called the reported Chinese missile launches in the South China Sea “destabilising”.

The statement comes after US Special Presidential Envoy for Arms Control Marshall S. Billingslea wrote on Twitter that China is mistaken if it believes launching ballistic missiles could intimidate Washington.

According to the South China Morning Post, China fired two missiles into the South China Sea, with one of the missiles, a DF-26B, being fired from the province of Qinghai, and the other, a DF-21D, from Zhejiang province. Both landed in an area that had been closed off in connection with military drills. The report said, citing a source, that this was an act of “warning” to the United States after a US spy plane trespassed into a no-fly zone that had been declared by Beijing during a military drill off its northern coast.

The newspaper’s source said it was China’s response to potential risks brought by the “increasingly frequent incoming US warplanes and military vessels in the South China Sea”.

According to the SCMP, the missile launch occurred one day after China said an American U-2 reconnaissance aircraft had a no-fly area entered without permission during a Chinese live-fire naval drill in the Bohai Sea.

China claims sovereignty over much of the South China Sea and has built military bases on artificial islands in the area. The United States views the sea as an international waterway and routinely defies China with patrols by US and allied warships in so-called freedom of navigation exercises.

285,https://www.infowars.com/hubble-maps-giant-halo-around-andromeda-galaxy/,2020-08-27T19:51:27,infowars,"In a landmark study, scientists using NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope have mapped the immense envelope of gas, called a halo, surrounding the Andromeda galaxy, our nearest large galactic neighbor.

Scientists were surprised to find that this tenuous, nearly invisible halo of diffuse plasma extends 1.3 million light-years from the galaxy—about halfway to our Milky Way—and as far as 2 million light-years in some directions. This means that Andromeda’s halo is already bumping into the halo of our own galaxy.

They also found that the halo has a layered structure, with two main nested and distinct shells of gas. This is the most comprehensive study of a halo surrounding a galaxy.

“Understanding the huge halos of gas surrounding galaxies is immensely important,” explained co-investigator Samantha Berek of Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut. “This reservoir of gas contains fuel for future star formation within the galaxy, as well as outflows from events such as supernovae. It’s full of clues regarding the past and future evolution of the galaxy, and we’re finally able to study it in great detail in our closest galactic neighbor.”

“We find the inner shell that extends to about a half million light-years is far more complex and dynamic,” explained study leader Nicolas Lehner of the University of Notre Dame in Indiana. “The outer shell is smoother and hotter. This difference is a likely result from the impact of supernova activity in the galaxy’s disk more directly affecting the inner halo.”

A signature of this activity is the team’s discovery of a large amount of heavy elements in the gaseous halo of Andromeda. Heavier elements are cooked up in the interiors of stars and then ejected into space—sometimes violently as a star dies. The halo is then contaminated with this material from stellar explosions.

The Andromeda galaxy, also known as M31, is a majestic spiral of perhaps as many as 1 trillion stars and comparable in size to our Milky Way. At a distance of 2.5 million light-years, it is so close to us that the galaxy appears as a cigar-shaped smudge of light high in the autumn sky. If its gaseous halo could be viewed with the naked eye, it would be about three times the width of the Big Dipper. This would easily be the biggest feature on the nighttime sky.

Through a program called Project AMIGA (Absorption Map of Ionized Gas in Andromeda), the study examined the light from 43 quasars—the very distant, brilliant cores of active galaxies powered by black holes—located far beyond Andromeda. The quasars are scattered behind the halo, allowing scientists to probe multiple regions. Looking through the halo at the quasars’ light, the team observed how this light is absorbed by the Andromeda halo and how that absorption changes in different regions. The immense Andromeda halo is made of very rarified and ionized gas that doesn’t emit radiation that is easily detectable. Therefore, tracing the absorption of light coming from a background source is a better way to probe this material.

DePasquale and E. Wheatley (STScI), and Z. Levay (background image)

The researchers used the unique capability of Hubble’s Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS) to study the ultraviolet light from the quasars. Ultraviolet light is absorbed by Earth’s atmosphere, which makes it impossible to observe with ground-based telescopes. The team used COS to detect ionized gas from carbon, silicon, and oxygen. An atom becomes ionized when radiation strips one or more electrons from it.

Andromeda’s halo has been probed before by Lehner’s team. In 2015, they discovered that the Andromeda halo is large and massive. But there was little hint of its complexity; now, it’s mapped out in more detail, leading to its size and mass being far more accurately determined.

“Previously, there was very little information—only six quasars—within 1 million light-years of the galaxy. This new program provides much more information on this inner region of Andromeda’s halo,” explained co-investigator J. Christopher Howk, also of Notre Dame. “Probing gas within this radius is important, as it represents something of a gravitational sphere of influence for Andromeda.”

Because we live inside the Milky Way, scientists cannot easily interpret the signature of our own galaxy’s halo. However, they believe the halos of Andromeda and the Milky Way must be very similar since these two galaxies are quite similar. The two galaxies are on a collision course, and will merge to form a giant elliptical galaxy beginning about 4 billion years from now.

Scientists have studied gaseous halos of more distant galaxies, but those galaxies are much smaller on the sky, meaning the number of bright enough background quasars to probe their halo is usually only one per galaxy. Spatial information is therefore essentially lost. With its close proximity to Earth, the gaseous halo of Andromeda looms large on the sky, allowing for a far more extensive sampling.

“This is truly a unique experiment because only with Andromeda do we have information on its halo along not only one or two sightlines, but over 40,” explained Lehner. “This is groundbreaking for capturing the complexity of a galaxy halo beyond our own Milky Way.”

In fact, Andromeda is the only galaxy in the universe for which this experiment can be done now, and only with Hubble. Only with an ultraviolet-sensitive future space telescope will scientists be able to routinely undertake this type of experiment beyond the approximately 30 galaxies comprising the Local Group.

“So Project AMIGA has also given us a glimpse of the future,” said Lehner.

The team’s findings appear in the Aug. 27 edition of The Astrophysical Journal.

Repeating identical talking points in Thursday appearances on CNN and MSNBC, Biden claimed that Trump is “absolutely” rooting for violence on the streets of America.

President Trump is ""absolutely"" rooting for violence on the streets of America, Joe Biden tells @andersoncooper. https://t.co/u4cLJqSJde pic.twitter.com/gGkO8Ecv5L — Anderson Cooper 360° (@AC360) August 27, 2020



“He views this as a political benefit to him. He’s rooting for more violence,” Biden told MSNBC. “He’s encouraging this. He’s not diminishing it at all. This is his America now.”

The former vice president quoted Trump aide Kellyanne Conway saying that chaos would be better for their side. “When has a president ever — a spokesperson for the president ever said something like that?” Biden asked.

Biden said he is open to visiting Wisconsin following days of violent protests there after police shot a Black man, but that it would have to be done safely and that he did not want to “become part of the problem.

Biden also addressed attacks on the seriousness of his Catholic faith from Catholic allies of Trump. “I think it’s kind of preposterous,” Biden said. “I never miss Mass. It’s part of who I am.” –Bloomberg

The former Vice President also addressed House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s suggestion that he skip debates with Trump, saying “As long as the commission continues down the straight and narrow as they have, I’m going to debate him.”

“I’m going to be a fact-checker on the floor, while I’m debating him.”

Perhaps Biden’s comments were inspired by a Thursday Politico article highlighting how the unrest in Kenosha and other parts of the country are “playing into Trump’s hands.”

“There’s no doubt it’s playing into Trump’s hands,” said former Madison, WI mayor Paul Soglin (D). There’s a significant number of undecided voters who are not ideological, and they can move very easily from Republican to the Democratic column and back again. They are, in effect, the people who decide elections. And they are very distraught about both the horrendous carnage created by police officers in murdering African Americans, and … for the safety of their communities.”

And as the New York Times notes:

While many demonstrators have been peaceful, others have set fire to buildings. At least four businesses downtown have been looted. Men armed with guns have shown up to confront protesters, leading to the shooting of three people, two of them fatally. On Wednesday, a white teenager from across the state line in Illinois was arrested in connection to the shooting, and Mr. Trump vowed to send in federal law enforcement and additional National Guard troops.

In Kenosha County, where the president won by fewer than 250 votes in 2016, those who already supported Mr. Trump said in interviews that the events of the past few days have simply reinforced their conviction that he is the man for the job. But some voters who were less sure of their choice said the chaos in their city and the inability of elected leaders to stop it were currently nudging them toward the Republicans.

“I’m not 100 percent sure of anything yet,” said 41-year-old tractor factory worker John Geraghty. “But as of now I’m really not happy about how Democrats are handling any of this.”

“The Democratic agenda to me right now is America is systematically racist and evil and the only people who can fix it are Democrats,” he added. “That’s the vibe I get.”

And in a poll taken between June and early august – before the Kenosha riots, Marquette Law School found that public support for Black Lives Matter in Wisconsin had dropped from +25 to +0 in Wisconsin over the course of two months.

Democrats need to be extremely concerned about what's happening in Wisconsin, where support for BLM has gone from +25 to +0 in 2 months. https://t.co/2wNMWoW6it — Jonathan Chait (@jonathanchait) August 27, 2020



The Times notes the case of 62-year-old flooring company owner Don Biehn, who was standing in line at a gun store on Tuesday afternoon to buy his first pistol in order to protect his business.

Mr. Biehn said he had been calling county and state officials for days, trying to explain how grave the situation was.

…

“There’s people running all over with guns — it’s like some Wild West town,” Mr. Biehn said. “We are just waiting here like sitting ducks waiting to get picked off.”

He added: “It’s chaos — everybody is afraid.”

Mr. Trump, he said, “was not my man,” but now he is grateful he is president. –New York Times

And here’s the punchline from the New York Times:

“Some Democrats, nervous about condemning the looting because they said they understood the rage behind it, worried that what was happening in their town might backfire and aid the president’s re-election prospects.”

287,https://www.infowars.com/in-july-money-supply-growth-hit-a-new-high-for-the-fourth-month-in-a-row/,2020-08-27T19:45:14,infowars,"In July, for the fourth month in a row, money supply growth surged to an all-time high, following new all-time highs in April, May, and June that came in the wake of unprecedented quantitative easing, central bank asset purchases, and various stimulus packages.

The growth rate has never been higher, with the 1970s being the only period that comes close. It was expected that money supply growth would surge in recent months. This usually happens in the wake of the early months of a recession or financial crisis. But it appears that now the United States is several months into an extended economic crisis, with around 1 million new jobless claims each week now the “norm” for the past two months. The central bank continues to engage in a wide variety of unprecedented efforts to “stimulate” the economy and provide income to the approximately 12 to 15 million unemployed workers. Moreover, as government revenues have fallen considerably, Congress has turned to unprecedented amounts of borrowing. But in order to keep interest rates low, the Fed has been buying up trillions in assets—including government debt. This has fueled new money creation.

During July 2020, year-over-year (YOY) growth in the money supply was at 36.9 percent. That’s up from June’s rate of 34.4 percent, and up from July 2019’s rate of 2.21 percent. Historically this is a very large surge in growth, both month over month and year over year. It is also quite a reversal from the trend that only just ended in August of last year, when growth rates were nearly bottoming out around 2 percent. In August, the growth rate hit a 120-month low, falling to the lowest growth rates we’d seen since 2007.

The money supply metric used here—the “true” or Rothbard-Salerno money supply measure (TMS)—is the metric developed by Murray Rothbard and Joseph Salerno, and is designed to provide a better measure of money supply fluctuations than M2. The Mises Institute now offers regular updates on this metric and its growth. This measure of the money supply differs from M2 in that it includes Treasury deposits at the Fed (and excludes short-time deposits, traveler’s checks, and retail money funds).

The M2 growth rate also increased to historic highs in July, growing 23.2 percent compared to June’s growth rate of 22.8 percent. M2 grew 5 percent during July of last year. The M2 growth rate had fallen considerably from late 2016 to late 2018 but has been growing again in recent months. As of March, it is following the same trend as TMS.

Money supply growth can often be a helpful measure of economic activity. During periods of economic boom, money supply tends to grow quickly as banks make more loans. Recessions, on the other hand, tend to be preceded by periods of slowdown in rates of money supply growth. However, money supply growth tends to grow out of its low-growth trough well before the onset of recession. As recession nears, the TMS growth rate climbs and becomes larger than the M2 growth rate. This occurred in the early months of the 2002 and the 2009 crises. February 2020 was the first month since late 2008 that the TMS growth rate climbed higher than the M2 growth rate. The TMS growth rate again exceeded M2 in March, April, and June 2020. As of mid-July 2020, it does appear that the decline in money supply growth has again preceded a recession, and a severe one at that. GDP fell 9.5 percent year over year during the second quarter of 2020. While a single quarter of decline would not meet the definition of “recession” now commonly used by economists, the US will have to stage an enormous economic comeback during the third quarter to avoid what most everyone will admit is a serious recession.

Although some observers will likely claim that the current economic crisis is a result solely of the covid-19 panic and resulting government-forced shutdowns, several indicators do suggest that the economy was primed for a recession. The preceding decline in TMS is one of these indicators, as is the late 2019 liquidity crisis in the repo markets. The Fed’s moves to drop interest rates and to once again grow its balance sheet speak to the weakness of the economy leading up to April 2020.

After initial balance sheet growth in late 2019, total Fed assets surged to nearly $7.2 trillion in June and have rarely dipped below the $7 trillion mark since then. These new asset purchases have set a new all-time high and are propelling the Fed balance sheet far beyond anything seen during the Great Recession’s stimulus packages. The Fed’s assets are now up more than 600 percent from the period immediately preceding the 2008 financial crisis.

While Fed asset purchases are not solely responsible for the surge in new money creation, they are certainly a sizable factor. Bank loan activity has surged as well, also driving new money creation.

Below is the dollar volume for M2 and TMS:

In terms of total dollar amounts now extant, the overall M2 total money supply in July was $18.2 trillion and the TMS total was $18.4 trillion. Since January, this is an increase of $2.8 trillion in M2 and $4.2 trillion in the TMS.

288,https://www.infowars.com/christchurch-shooter-sentenced-to-life-in-jail/,2020-08-27T19:37:16,infowars,"The gunman who killed 51 Muslim worshippers last year in New Zealand’s deadliest shooting attack was sentenced to life imprisonment by a court on Thursday.

He is the first person in the country to get a life sentence without the possibility of parole.

Judge Cameron Mander of the Christchurch High Court said that a finite term would not be sufficient.

“Your crimes … are so wicked that even if you are detained until you die it will not exhaust the requirements of punishment and denunciation,” said Mander as he handed down a sentence unprecedented in New Zealand legal history.

“Your actions were inhuman,” the judge said. “You deliberately killed a 3-year-old infant as he clung to the leg of his father…As far as I can discern, you are empty of any empathy for your victims.”

Live-streaming terrorism

The sentencing comes after three days of emotionally charged statements from survivors and the families of the victims in court. The shooter was largely emotionless throughout the proceedings, as the victims gave harrowing testimonies of what was New Zealand’s worst terror attack and its impact on their lives.

The 29-year-old Australian white supremacist had admitted to 51 charges of murder, 40 of attempted murder, and one charge of terrorism over the 2019 attack outside two mosques in the city of Christchurch. He live-streamed the act on social media and also uploaded a manifesto shortly before the shootings.

‘New Zealand’s worst murderer’

Crown prosecutor Mark Zarifeh said the attack was “without comparison in New Zealand’s criminal history”.

“The offending was motivated by an entrenched racist and xenophobic ideology… in my submission, the offender is clearly New Zealand’s worst murderer,” he said.

Zarifeh said life behind bars was “the only proper sentencing option” for the shooter.

The shooter had sacked his legal team last month intending to represent himself.

He waived his right to speak at the sentencing. Instead, he made a brief statement through a court-appointed lawyer before the sentencing, saying the shooter “does not oppose the application that he should be sentenced to life imprisonment without parole.”

This eased concerns that he may use the platform to talk about his extremist ideology.

Until ‘his last breath’

The families of the victims had called for the harshest possible punishment for the gunman. New Zealand does not have the death penalty, but some angry survivors called for just that.

Life imprisonment is the most severe punishment in the country. While the Sentencing Act requires a minimum of 10-17 years in prison before the possibility of parole, a judge can sentence a convict to life imprisonment without the possibility of release.

“He deserves not a life imprisonment term of 17, 25 or 30 years, but life imprisonment until his last gasp, his last breath,” Hamimah Tuyan, whose husband Zekeriya died of his wounds 48 days after the attack, told the court on Wednesday.

Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern welcomed the sentence and acknowledged the strength of the Muslim community at a press conference on Thursday.

“You relived the horrific events of March 15 to chronicle what happened that day and the pain it has left behind,” Ardern said. “Nothing will take the pain away but I hope you felt the arms of New Zealand around you through this whole process, and I hope you continue to feel that through all the days that follow.”

“The trauma of March 15 is not easily healed but today I hope is the last where we have any cause to hear or utter the name of the terrorist behind it,” she said. “His deserves to be a lifetime of complete and utter silence.”

289,https://www.infowars.com/why-americans-are-looking-for-a-safe-haven-from-the-dollar/,2020-08-27T19:30:31,infowars,"As the Federal Reserve’s quantitative easing practices generate the biggest debt bubble in history, gold futures are trading at record highs, a phenomenon some have called “a bit of a mystery.”

However, this “mystery” was solved long ago by the laws of economics. The only “mystery” here is why—contrary to centuries of economic wisdom—we allowed centralized paper money to become the dominant form of currency in the first place.

As recent waves of civil unrest and economic turmoil have prompted some to look back in time and reflect on the observations of the Founding Fathers, it seems most have opted to reject them entirely. Yet among the founders’ many warnings against the institutions that would eventually dominate the modern world are the timeless—and astonishingly accurate—warnings against central banking.

On August 1, 1787, George Washington wrote in a letter to Thomas Jefferson that “paper currency [can] ruin commerce, oppress the honest, and open the door to every species of fraud and injustice.” Jefferson also opposed the concept, warning that “banking establishments are more dangerous than standing armies.” James Madison called paper money “unjust,” recognizing that it allowed the government to confiscate and redistribute property through inflation: “It affects the rights of property as much as taking away equal value in land.”

In other words, inflation is a hidden form of taxation. Washington understood this. Jefferson understood this. Madison understood this. And generations of preeminent economists since then—from Ludwig von Mises to F.A. Hayek, to Murray Rothbard—have understood this quite clearly.

And there’s nothing controversial or mysterious about sound money, that is, currency backed by some form of secure, fixed weight commodity like gold or silver. Both have been valued in some fashion for six thousand years and have been used as currency for around twenty-six hundred years. As confidence in the dollar continues to nosedive, the market is not only putting more confidence in gold and silver, but in some cryptocurrencies sharing many of the characteristics of gold.

The presidencies of Woodrow Wilson and Franklin D. Roosevelt are rightfully regarded as some of the darkest years for freedom in America. Often overlooked, however, are the deeply repressive monetary policies introduced by both presidents. In 1838, Senator John C. Calhoun foreshadowed the economic evils that would eventually emerge at the peak of the Progressive Era, explaining, “It is the nature of stimulus…to excite first, and then depress afterwards….Nothing is more stimulating than an expanding and depreciating currency. It creates a delusive appearance of prosperity, which puts everything in motion. Everyone feels as if he was growing richer as prices rise.”

Seventy-five years later, the autocrats running the Wilson administration dealt two devastating blows to liberty with the Federal Reserve Act and the Revenue Act, forever marking 1913 as a tragic year for liberty. Both laws struck at the heart of property rights by establishing the Federal Reserve System and the income tax, respectively. Then, in 1933, Roosevelt issued Executive Order No. 6102, requiring Americans to surrender much of their gold to the US government. Shortly after, Congress passed the Gold Reserve Act of 1934, artificially raising the price of gold and guaranteeing the government a profit of $14.33 for each ounce of gold it had seized from the people.

Finally, in 1971, President Richard Nixon—like any self-respecting twentieth-century Keynesian—committed himself to finishing the work of Wilson and Roosevelt by closing the gold window, forever divorcing the gold standard from the dollar. Rather than usher in a new era of economic stability, this unnatural union between the Fed and the federal government produced a vicious loop of boom-bust cycles and depressions. The consequences have not only been inflation and devaluation (both of which have stripped the people of their purchasing power and savings); now, every time a depression hits, the government is allowed to do two things: grow its power and tax and spend at will without fear of accountability.

In other words, with every inflation of currency comes an inflation of government power.

With government shutdowns of local economies, the second economic quarter of this year was among the worst in history, with the total debt-to-GDP reaching a staggering 136 percent. As the national debt approaches $27 trillion (with even bigger spending bills in the works), we can expect the days of such flagrant government spending to come to a screeching halt. If we continue on this path, that correction will result in an unprecedented collapse of the dollar and the monetary system. The ultimate danger in this scenario: the government eventually confiscates the vast majority or even all private property in order to pay off the national debt. As German American economist Hans Sennholz once said, “Government debt is a government claim against personal income and private property—an unpaid tax bill.”

This is why a dramatic downsizing of government is key to bringing the US out of this manic, outmoded cycle of depressions and upswings. For the government to fulfill its core function as a safeguard of liberty, we must prevent it from meddling in affairs beyond the boundaries prescribed by the Founding Fathers. This includes a swift withdrawal from the use of paper fiat currency and spending cuts across the board.

Such a sweeping transformation could begin with the state governments, the legislatures of which could override the federal government by passing legislation allowing individuals to use gold and silver currency.

Regardless, if meaningful legislative action is not taken somewhere, we have little choice other than to acquiesce to the gloom and terror of socialism—a system that would devour all in its path and make slaves of once free people for generations to come. Freedom is the natural ability of people to control their own destiny. Sound money has the ability to help keep people free.

290,https://www.infowars.com/feds-cure-for-coronavirus-economic-meltdown-actually-part-of-problem/,2020-08-27T19:25:19,infowars,"Last month, gold broke its all-time record price. As we have explained, to really understand what’s going on, you need to flip the equation. Dollars are at an all-time record low compared to gold. Simply put, the recent surge in gold prices is all about currency debasement.

We were on this path long before coronavirus reared its ugly head. After all, this gold bull market started back in 2015. But the government response to the pandemic put the process in hyperdrive. In March, the Federal Reserve embarked on a policy of money printing to infinity and beyond. And there is no end in sight. The Fed is apparently even willing to turn the other way the inevitable result of printing money – price inflation – begins to become apparent in the economy.

As economist Patrick Barron pointed out in an article published at the Mises Wire, unsound money has been at the heart of disastrous government policies throughout history. This time is no different. The Fed “cure” for the coronavirus economic meltdown is really part of the problem.

The following article by Patrick Barron was originally published at the Mises Wire. The opinions expressed for your consideration are the author’s and do not necessarily reflect those of Peter Schiff or SchiffGold.

Austrian school economists know that unsound money has been at the heart of disastrous government policies since time immemorial. The greater the ignorance of money, the greater the monetary debasement in order to fund government’s latest folly.

Monetary debasement always ends badly, but end it will. Robert L. Shuettinger and Eamon Butler, cofounder and director of the Adam Smith Institute, wrote Forty Centuries of Wage and Price Controls: How Not to Fight Inflation (2009), a very readable short book that covers a vast expanse of time. In The Ethics of Money Production, Jörg Guido Hülsmann outlined all the various schemes used over the millennia by those in government to counterfeit the lifeblood of the economy for their own purposes. But Professor Hulsmann, who wrote the book in 2010, probably could not have predicted the scale of today’s money expansion. What is the point of all this?

Well, the point is that the ignorant public and the tyrants who rule them apparently believe that all that is wanting to achieve some great goal is money. And since government can conjure all the money that it desires out of thin air, government ought to do so. It’s really as simple as that.

Fiat Money Makes Keynesian Economics Appear to Be Possible

Along the way some almost universally accepted economic principles have had to be shunted aside. John Maynard Keynes, author of The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money and considered to be the father of modern macroeconomics, managed to concoct a new economic school of thought that completely ignored Say’s law. No longer was money an indirect medium of exchange to facilitate the transfer of real goods and services for other real goods and services, what Frank Shostak calls the exchange of “something for something.” No. Now money itself could be conjured out of thin air and used to confiscate real goods and services. No longer would government be forced to convince its constituents that its latest spending proposal was so necessary that it could justify an increase in taxes and/or the reduction or elimination of some other spending programs. Barring the failure of those two funding options, it would no longer be forced, as it had in the past, to convince savers that its credit was good. In other words, spending would be completely unshackled from the reality of uncertainty and scarcity.

Fiat Money Hides the Consequences of Lockdowns

The coronavirus pandemic has exposed the hollowness of what is called modern monetary theory (MMT). The horrible consequences of government shutdowns throughout the country have been truly “papered over” with trillions of dollars of fiat money through so-called stimulus checks, handouts to politically connected businesses, and boosts in unemployment payments. Real money would have revealed the damage to the world economy long ago, and I am do not doubt that shutdowns would have quickly stopped being used as a tool for controlling the virus. As it is, the shutdowns linger in many parts of the world, because the consequences are not yet fully seen.

The End of the Credit Cycle

Yet the coronavirus-inspired shutdowns and helicopter money to placate a frightened populace are merely the latest examples of foolish government policies made possible only by the government’s ability to conjure money out of thin air. The broader background of weakening bank balance sheets has ensured a recession and possibly a depression through bank credit expansion funded not by an increase in real savings but central banks. In his latest warning that the end of the most recent credit cycle is nigh, Alasdair Macleod of Goldmoney.com paints a bleak picture of the weakness of the “globally systemically important banks” (G-SIBs):

the elephant in the room is systemic risk — visible to all but simply ignored. This is partly due to everyone in government and central banks, as well as their epigones in the investment industry and mainstream media, believing our economic problems are only a matter of Covid-19. Governments have introduced emergency plans. The US Government is distributing money by metaphorical helicopters, and Britain has a furlough scheme and tax deferments. But they do little to alleviate the concerns of highly leveraged commercial bankers, facing the prospects of soaring bad debts. Bank balance sheet asset values to market capitalisation ratios strongly suggest the banking system cannot cope with what is ahead.

There is NOTHING that government can do to help the economy other than remove barriers to wealth creation and preservation that it itself created and allow the people the freedom to pursue their own ends. Since government creates nothing itself, all interventions interfere with what the people themselves desire and are nothing more than transfers of wealth for the benefit of some and the destruction of wealth for all. Yet wealth destruction may not be the worst thing that can happen. A nation can lose its freedom entirely when government doubles down and doubles down time and again in the pursuit of phantom fixes with ever-increasing amounts of fiat money conjured out of thin air. It happened in Rome (Inflation and the Fall of Rome, a speech by Joseph R. Peden). It happened in Weimar Germany (When Money Dies, by Adam Fergusson).

It certainly can happen here and now.

36-year-old Joseph Rosenbaum was one of two men killed by Rittenhouse, who was not the first to discharge his gun and was clearly acting in self-defense.

Following the shooting, it was revealed that Rosenbaum was on Wisconsin’s sex offender registry and was convicted for “sexual conduct with a minor.”

The 3 shot (2 killed) in #Kenosha, Wisc. at the BLM riot have been identified. Joseph Rosenbaum, 36, was the first one killed. Video allegedly shows him chasing teen shooter & throwing something at him. Rosenbaum was a registered sex offender for a sex crime involving a minor. pic.twitter.com/up1VgDyrgZ — Andy Ngô (@MrAndyNgo) August 27, 2020

Reporter Julio Rosas revealed that he caught Rosenbaum on camera earlier in the night trying to provoke armed citizens and using racial slurs.

The clip shows Rosenbaum repeating the phrase, “Shoot me, nigga!”

Now that it is confirmed Joseph Rosenbaum was one of the people shot and killed by alleged gunman Kyle Rittenhouse in Kenosha, I filmed him earlier in the night taunting the armed civilians, saying, ""Shoot me, n***a."" pic.twitter.com/Nn2encm78Y — Julio Rosas (@Julio_Rosas11) August 27, 2020

Given that Rosenbaum was white and he used the n-word, it wouldn’t be totally outside the realms of plausibility for the left to try to drop this story altogether, although their effort to vilify Rittenhouse as a “domestic terrorist” still appears to be the stronger motivation.

While the footage shows Rittenhouse clearly acted in self-defense, Congresswoman Ilhan Omar labeled him a “domestic terrorist” who “executed two people.”

“Their murderous rants have inspired many mass shooters and now they aren’t even trying to distance themselves from it, they are excusing it,” said Omar.

She appears to have forgotten about the numerous actual mass shootings carried out by gunmen in the name of Black Lives Matter.

293,https://www.infowars.com/researchers-spot-clear-evidence-of-stars-being-devoured-by-black-holes/,2020-08-27T18:30:42,infowars,"In at least one tidal disruption event, researchers have paid attention to previously unseen double peaks that only briefly popped up for telescopes to see before fading, and it appears the light formations account for an iconic accretion disc – a structure formed by diffuse material in orbital motion.

Researchers might know perfectly well what a so-called tidal disruption – or stellar collapse – is, but it has hitherto been hard to come to grips with this devouring event and find evidence (if any) of X-ray emissions that can establish the presence of an accretion disc, typically formed by diffuse material around a massive star.

However, now, using optical ultraviolet observations of a tidal disruption event, astronomers have managed to pin down the alternating light, which is expected for a rotating accretion disc, as follows from a study due to be published in The Astrophysical Journal.

“… For most TDEs, we don’t see X-rays – they mostly shine in the ultraviolet and optical wavelengths – so it was suggested that, instead of a disc, we’re seeing emissions from the collision of stellar debris streams”, explained one member of the research group, astronomer Tiara Hung of the University of California Santa Cruz.

According to her colleague from the same university, astrophysicist Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz, the recent study is the first solid proof that accretion discs form in these events, irrespective of whether or not we see X-rays.

The said disruption took place in the centre of a galaxy called 2MASS J10065085+0141342, located 624 million light-years away.

In late 2018, the astronomers first spotted a unique flare indicating that a supermassive black hole therein was shredding a star, and the researchers analysed multiple wavelengths as the light evolved and grew in size, in a tidal disruption event named AT 2018hyz at the time.

Later, they managed to conclude that a giant black hole exceeding the mass of the Sun by several million times had disrupted the star, leaving a curious thing visible – a double peak in the so-called Balmer emission, generated when electrons in hydrogen atoms transit to a lower energy level.

“What stood out was the hydrogen line – the emission from hydrogen gas – which had a double-peaked profile that was unlike any other TDE we’d seen”, said astrophysicist Ryan Foley of the UCSC, explaining that the double peak in an active galactic nucleus is largely taken as evidence of an accretion disc.

Waves of light that are emitted from something moving towards us tend to be shorter on the blue side of the spectrum, or blueshifted. Yet, light waves from a shrinking object are lengthened, or redshifted. The evidence of both of these shifts comes in handy not merely in determining rotation as such, but the velocity of this rotation.

“Our simulations show that what we observe is very sensitive to the inclination. There is a preferred orientation to see these double-peak features, and a different orientation to see X-ray emissions”, according to Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz, who in 2018 co-authored a paper presenting a unified model for tidal disruption events.

The team moved on to make further multi-wavelength observations, likening them to other TDEs, and finally arrived at conclusions that the accretion disc was made up of around five percent of the star’s initial mass and that it formed quickly, within just one month. A similar conclusion was, incidentally, reached by an international team of researchers led by astronomer Phil Short of the University of Edinburgh in Scotland.

In a pre-print arXiv paper, Short and his team note that “AT 2018hyz is the first TDE in which clear, double-peaked emission lines have been observed and provides strong observational evidence that accretion discs form in at least some TDEs and are a significant source of the observed luminosity”.

Guangcheng, who was thrown in prison from 2006 to 2012 for challenging China’s one-child policy, called out the communist superstate’s strict surveillance and censorship of its people.

“The CCP is an enemy of humanity,” Guangcheng said, reading his speech in braille. “It is terrorizing its own people, and it is threatening the wellbeing of the world.”

“In China, expressing beliefs or ideas not approved by the CCP, religion, democracy, human rights, can lead to prison. The nation lives under mass surveillance and censorship. The US must use its values of freedom, democracy, and the rule of law to gather a coalition of other democracies to stop CCP’s aggression.”

Guangcheng concluded by throwing his support behind US President Donald Trump, saying he’s shown the courage to keep China in check.

“Standing up to fight unfairness isn’t easy, I know, so does president Trump, but he has shown the courage to lead that fight.”

Greetings. My name is Chen Guangcheng. Standing up to tyranny is not easy, I know. When I spoke out against China’s one-child policy and other injustices, I was prosecuted, beaten, sent to prison and put under house arrest by the Chinese Communist Party, the CCP. In April, 2012, I escaped and was given shelter in the American Embassy in Beijing. I’m forever grateful to the American people for welcoming me and my family to the United States, where we are now free. The CCP is an enemy of humanity. It is terrorizing its own people, and it is threatening the wellbeing of the world. In China, expressing beliefs or ideas not approved by the CCP, religion, democracy, human rights, can lead to prison. The nation lives under mass surveillance and censorship. The US must use its values of freedom, democracy, and the rule of law to gather a coalition of other democracies to stop CCP’s aggression. President Trump had led on this and we need the other countries to join him in this fight, a fight for our future. Standing up to fight unfairness isn’t easy, I know, so does president Trump, but he has shown the courage to lead that fight. We need to support, vote and fight for President Trump for the sake of the world. Thank you.

Video suggests Huber was the man who attacked Rittenhouse with a skateboard as the alleged shooter attempted to flee the scene after shooting another man, convicted pedophile Joseph Rosenbaum. As Rittenhouse ran toward police vehicles approaching the scene, Rosenbaum and others appear to have tackled Rittenhouse. One man attacked him with a skateboard, while another man had a pistol.

Huber was arrested in 2012 for charges including domestic violence, “Use of Dangerous Weapon,” “Strangulation & Suffocation,” “False Imprisonment,” and battery. He was ultimately convicted of strangling and falsely imprisoning a person.

Huber was sentenced to two years in prison, and was credited for 352 days served during his case. He was released from probation for this conviction in May of 2020.

Then, in 2018, after Huber was released from prison but still on probation for his 2012 conviction, he was arrested for domestic abuse, disorderly conduct, and battery. He was ultimately convicted and sentenced to probation.

Huber was also caught in possession of drug paraphernalia, which is not a criminal offense in the state of Wisconsin, in 2015.

While GoFundMe banned a campaign raising money for Rittenhouse, but recently promoted Huber’s campaign on its official corporate Twitter account.

Huber is one of the two men who did not survive their encounter with Rittenhouse on Tuesday night, succumbing to his injuries. He is remembered fondly by the local skateboard community, who paid tribute to him after his death. Huber, who had a 2-year-old daughter, was 25 at the time of his death.

The city has been plagued by rioting, looting, violence and arson all week following the police killing of Jacob Blake, culminating in the Tuesday night shooting of three BLM protesters, two fatally, by a 17-year-old who acted in self-defense.

A new poll suggests that the bedlam is turning people against Black Lives Matter, and by proxy Joe Biden, who has endorsed BLM on numerous occasions.

“Democrats need to be extremely concerned about what’s happening in Wisconsin, where support for BLM has gone from +25 to +0 in 2 months,” tweeted Jonathan Chait.

He cites a newly released RPubs poll which also shows that approval for Black Lives Matter amongst whites has dropped from +22 to -5 since June.

The poll was taken before much of the violence unfolded in Kenosha, meaning the numbers are likely even worse for BLM approval.

The poll numbers are backed up by anecdotal evidence from a New York Times article about how the violence is “already swaying some voters in Kenosha.”

The article quotes several voters who say their support for Trump has hardened because of the riots, while also highlighting how the chaos is driving Democrats away from Joe Biden.

For example, 59-year-old Scott Haight said he was a “lifelong Democrat” but that he isn’t going to vote this year.

Priscella Gazda, who only voted once in her life – for Obama in 2008 – told the newspaper, “I am going to vote for Trump. He seems to be more about the American people and what we need.”

As we highlighted earlier this week, people like Don Lemon are suddenly expressing concern that the relentless rioting is harming Democrats’ chances in the 2020 election.

“I think Democrats are ignoring this problem or hoping that it will go away…Joe Biden may be afraid to do it…He’s got to address it. He’s got to come out and talk about it,” said the CNN host.

A CNN poll earlier this month also found that Biden’s lead over Trump had dropped from 14 points in early June to just 4 points following three months of unrest.

A separate Pew poll also found that almost as many American voters now view violent crime as an important election issue compared to coronavirus, something that is likely to help President Trump.

“A sizable 59 percent of voters in the survey indicate that violent crime, which President Trump has framed as happening in Democrat-controlled cities, is a “very important” factor in casting their ballots,” writes Rusty Weiss.

Democrats are clearly starting to become very nervous that more moderate voters are turned off by Black Lives Matter/Antifa rioting, but the notion that they can do anything to reign in the mayhem looks incredibly unlikely.

“Collin County is providing COVID-19 numbers and data as a convenience to our residents, however, Department of State Health Services (DSHS) officials have acknowledged that the active case count for Collin County is significantly overstated,” reads a disclaimer on the county’s web site. “We advise residents that Collin County lacks confidence in the data currently being provided to us.”

“DSHS officials have agreed to immediately redirect resources to correct the issue, but have not provided a timeline on when their reports will be corrected.”

The DSHS data reported over 4600 active cases in Collin Co. on Aug. 25:

Compare that to the revised active cases on Aug. 26 of just 81:

It appears most of the active cases were recalculated as ‘recovered:’

According to the Community Impact newsletter:

County Judge Chris Hill said he has had “significant conversations” with DSHS officials about their plans to address issues raised by commissioners. After the revision to the disclaimer was approved, Hill explained DSHS planned to set up a Collin County work group Aug. 25 that will be committed to rectifying the county’s backlog of cases.

“They’re going to be working to call everyone who’s on that list that’s currently active to determine whether or not they’re still active or whether or not they’re recovered,” he said.

Hill said the work group will be checking whether patients currently classified as active cases of COVID-19 have been symptom-free for 10 days so they can be reclassified as recovered. He also explained that if the group is unable to reach a patient after three attempts, they will be reclassified as recovered.

The “work group” consists of 12 private contractors performing an audit of the data.

State officials claimed the inaccurate numbers were due to a “backlog” that had “recently included some older cases,” a questionable statement given that Collin Co. active case numbers were apparently overstated by over 5600%.



Flashback: A Collin Co. Judge warned that Texas’ case numbers would be inflated after the started counting “probable cases” without testing back in May.

In short, “some older cases” doesn’t explain the difference between 81 and over 4600.

Unfortunately, the DSHS data is what Texas Gov. Greg Abbott relied on when he advocated face mask wearing, business shutdowns and ‘social distancing’ across the state.

According to an Aug. 16 article by the El Paso Times:

“Listen, there’s a reality: People have had an altered state of life for the past few months. One that requires wearing a mask. One that requires staying at home if at all possible. One that reduces your level of [activity] with others,” Abbott said. “That’s a challenge, a once in a lifetime challenge, and it’s easy to get a sense of fatigue. It’s easy to want to stop having to comply with those standards.”

[…]

As of Thursday, the Texas Department of State Health Services was reporting 513,575 coronavirus cases in Texas, with an estimated 128,526 active cases. The state reported 9,289 fatalities.

This Aug. 16 active case number is now suspect given the recent revision by Collin Co.

Joseph Rosenbaum, also known as “Jojo,” 36, was allegedly shot in the head by Kyle Rittenhouse in a shooting that was caught on camera from multiple after an argument emerged when the teenager traveled about 10 miles to Kenosha to protect local businesses from looting and to provide medical aid to those who needed it.

Rosenbaum, a father of a two-year-old girl, according to USA News Posts, was one of three gunshot victims–two of which were fatal–in the incident.

Internet sleuths later revealed that Rosenbaum was a convicted pedophile after a conviction for sexual conduct with a minor from December 2002 came to light as the pasts of those involved were dredged up following the ensuing chaos to find control over the narrative.

Apparently the guy that got shot in the head in Kenosha was a registered sex offender! @Job4_2 ❤️ pic.twitter.com/AoirePVBIL — Dame Pesos (@cenkpesos) August 27, 2020

Rosenbaum was sentenced to 12 and a half years for two counts of sexual conduct with a minor. He served his sentence in Arizona State Prison Complex-Eyman where he racked up 42 disciplinary infractions behind bars during his lengthy sentence.

Following his stint at the Arizona State Prison Complex-Eyman, Rosenbaum was convicted of a parole violation where he was accused of tampering with a monitoring device.

Tributes poured in to celebrate the lives of those shot by Rittenhouse, who has since been arrested and charged with first-degree murder in what many on the internet have defended as self-defense.

Violence is expected to continue in Kenosha after police were called on a home disturbance that ended with Jacob Blake sustaining four gunshot wounds from behind at close range after he resisted arrested and attempted to leave the scene.

The Wisconsin Department of Justice later confirmed in a statement that Blake had a weapon on his vehicle’s floorboard as activists begun to spin a narrative to suggest that the shooting was of an unarmed black man–in concert with the same narrative to have emboldened rioters and protesters around the world throughout the summer.

Rosenbaum appears to be the man seen repeatedly shouting “shoot me n**ga” at Rittenhouse shortly before the shooting began on Tuesday night.

302,https://www.infowars.com/video-analysis-proves-kyle-rittenhouse-did-not-shoot-first/,2020-08-27T15:20:25,infowars,"New video analysis of the incident in Kenosha during which two people were shot dead proves that Kyle Rittenhouse did not shoot first and acted in self-defense.

Rittenhouse shot three rioters during the confrontation, killing two, one of whom was a convicted pedophile and on the Wisconsin sex offenders registry.

Video footage and images from the incident show how Rittenhouse was being pursued and physically attacked before firing any shots.

One of the individuals he shot was carrying a handgun, while another tried to hit him over the head with a skateboard and another aimed a kick at his head as he lay on the ground.

Now new analysis of footage that preceded Rittenhouse discharging his AR-15 by New York Times Visual Investigations journalist Christiaan Triebert shows that the 17-year-old did not shoot first.

“At 23:19, Rittenhouse is seen in this YouTube livestream. He’s being chased into a parking lot. While he is being pursued, an unknown gunman fires the first shot into the air,” tweeted Triebert.

The muzzle flash of the first shot can also be seen in the video from a different angle.

Rittenhouse has been charged with 1st degree murder, presumably to satiate the Black Lives Matter mob, but all the evidence clearly shows he acted in self-defense.

One wonders if the media will acknowledge that there were at least two gunmen involved in the confrontation and that the one pursuing Rittenhouse fired his weapon first.

Wow.

Almost as if people who attach themselves to Black Lives Matter have nothing to do with seeking “justice” and everything to do with wanton, opportunistic criminality.

“Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo dispelled rumors on social media about the death of the unidentified Black man suspected in a Wednesday afternoon homicide who later fatally shot himself on the Nicollet Mall as officers approached,” reports CBS Minnestoa.

This is what lead to the Minneapolis unrest? My soul is exhausted. pic.twitter.com/DehiwJxL4Z — Kalen From Scriberr (@FromKalen) August 27, 2020

“The incident, which was captured on city surveillance video and released by police within 90 minutes, nonetheless sparked protests and looting in the heart of downtown.”

The video of the suicide clearly shows the African-American male shoot himself in the head. Immediately after the shooting, officers rush over to perform CPR in an effort to save the man’s life.

However, given that any death of a black person, whether justified or not, is now immediately seized upon as excuse for looting, violence and mayhem, BLM supporters in Minneapolis didn’t seem to care about what really happened and began rioting anyway.

IDS Center, Nordstrom Rack, Foot Locker, Haskell’s Wine and Spirits, Brit’s Pub, The Newsroom, Devil’s Advocate, Walgreens, CVS, Enterprise Rent-A-Car, Ruth’s Chris Steak House, Dahl Medical Supply and Caribou Coffee were all targeted by the mob.

The National Guard subsequently had to be called out to restore order.

“The supplier must adjust the performance that is required for this test to be used,” said the agency’s head microbiologist, Karin Tegmark Wiselll, who added that the test kit has been widely exported to other countries.

BGI Genomics, two of whose subsidiaries are on a U.S. economic blacklist of companies implicated in human rights violations regarding China’s treatment of Uighurs, could not immediately be reached for comment.

It received emergency use authorization from U.S. authorities for its coronavirus testing kits in March and got an Emergency Use Listing from the World Health Organization in May. – Reuters

The agency was unable to say how many tests had been done using the kit, but that the 3,700 false positives were a ‘minority of cases,’ and occurred when the virus is at very low levels. The Chinese test kits had only a marginal effect on Sweden’s COVID-19 statistics according to the report.

Sweden has had 86,891 confirmed infections and 5,814 deaths from the virus, according to the agency. Of note, deaths, infections and ICU admissions have been falling in recent weeks as the government explores easing their already-lax coronavirus restrictions, such as large public gatherings over 50 people and sporting events.

“President Trump condemns violence in all forms and believes we must protect all Americans from chaos and lawlessness,” White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany said in a statement on Wednesday night. “This is why he is encouraging Democrat governors to request the National Guard and federal law enforcement to augment their local law enforcement efforts.”

“We have assisted Wisconsin in the deployment of almost 1,000 National Guard and over 200 federal law enforcement personnel, which will include FBI and US Marshals.”

From the White House: pic.twitter.com/gDNNyZWkCI — Edward Keenan (@thekeenanwire) August 27, 2020

While Wisconsin Governor Evers said earlier on Wednesday that he would expand the Wisconsin Guard deployment in Kenosha from 250 to 500 troops, he made no mention of federal forces. The White House missive later clarified that 200 federal officers and nearly 1,000 Guardsmen from other states would join them, soon after the Department of Justice confirmed that the federal agents would be drawn from the FBI, ATF and US Marshal Service.

Hours after Evers’ statement announcing the expanded Guard presence, President Donald Trump said he had spoken to the governor, noting that he had “agreed to accept federal assistance,” though did not offer details on the deployments at the time. It is unclear if the federal initiative was spurred by a request by the Kenosha County Board earlier in the day, which had pleaded with Evers to send a total of 1,500 Guardsmen.

Unrest kicked off in Kenosha on Sunday, seeing protests over the police shooting of African American man Jacob Blake spiral into three nights of riots, looting and arson. While destruction was less widespread on Tuesday than the night prior, a dispute between protesters and those attempting to protect property ended in gunfire, leaving two dead. The 17-year-old suspect in the shooting has been taken into custody and charged with homicide.

Protesters have taken to the streets in Kenosha for a fourth night, defying a 7pm curfew in place until Sunday. Previous nights have seen unrest escalate later in the evening and into the next morning.

The White House has said the app, which is owned by ByteDance, is a threat to US national security.

The “political environment has sharply changed” since he took over the position in May, Mayer wrote in a letter to employees explaining his decision to leave.

US President Donald Trump in July moved to ban the app in the US, unless parent company ByteDance sells its US operations to an American company by mid-September.

“I have done significant reflection on what the corporate structural changes will require, and what it means for the global role I signed up for,” wrote Mayer, a former Disney executive who joined TikTok before the recent trade quarrel between the US and China.

“Against this backdrop, and as we expect to reach a resolution very soon, it is with a heavy heart that I wanted to let you all know that I have decided to leave the company.’’

Mayer was key argument against sale

“We appreciate that the political dynamics of the last few months have significantly changed what the scope of Kevin’s role would be going forward, and fully respect his decision. We thank him for his time at the company and wish him well,” a TikTok spokesperson said.

A US citizen, Mayer had been one of TikTok’s key counterarguments that the app was already US-based and not a surveillance tool of the Chinese government.

The wildly popular video app allows users to create and edit short videos.

The US military has already banned its use.

Trump has called for ByteDance to sell the app, likely to Microsoft, by mid-September, with any non-US roles shut down by November.

Illinois Rep. Sean Casten made the comments during a Zoom call with college students last week.

“If you are a constitutionalist, unless you’re a member of well-regulated militia, tell me why you need to own a gun, right? Having small genitals is not a sufficient reason to own a gun,” Casten declared.

Watch:

There you have it, an elected representative seriously proclaiming that if you exercise your Second Amendment rights it must mean you have a tiny penis (or vagina, presumably for women gun owners).

Casten is a strict gun control advocate, has pushed legislation to increase background checks, ban ‘assault weapons’, and has endorsed the anti-gun group Everytown.



Ali Alexander joins Alex Jones in-studio to break down the state of the election, and expose the satanic underbelly of the leftist elites.

In a statement to The Daily Caller, Republican Jeanne Ives’ campaign, (Casten’s opponent in Illinois) explained how the COngressman’s comments are not only derogatory, but also dangerous.

“Sean Casten references Justice John Paul Stevens’ dissent for the minority in Heller v. DC, which established the individual right to self-protection. Since he likes history, John Paul Stevens – after he left the bench – wrote an op-ed calling for the abolition of the Second Amendment,” the statement reads.

“That is what Sean Casten is referring to, as he ridicules law-abiding firearms owners as just ‘guys with small genitals.’ Sean Casten sold himself to IL06 as moderate in 2018. He represents decent professional people,” the statement continues.

“In this clip, he takes a radical position and describes those who oppose him in the most offensive, degrading terminology that he can possibly think of. Sean Casten has shown us who he is – an extremist, and what he wants – to abolish freedoms and make government your keeper. Our question to voters: Is that what you want?” the statement concludes.

The speakers who were the target of the abuse included First Lady Melania Trump, Republican Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron, Republican South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, former professional football player Herschel Walker, and former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley.

Unsurprisingly, it was CNN pushing the ‘fake diversity’ claims to begin with, as commentator Nia Malika Henderson suggested that the aforementioned speakers were being used to inject some false diversity when the Republican party is still “all about” white people.

“It’s sort of an indirect appeal to white voters when you kind of put black issues, black people, black Republicans front and center, as we saw happen tonight,” Henderson claimed, adding “Nikki Haley, obviously a woman of color and Tim Scott and a couple of other African Americans. I mean, on the whole the party isn’t very diverse. It seemed a little diverse tonight with Tim Scott making that final sort of key note address and Nikki Haley making a kind of key note address.”

Rasmussen confirmed the findings Wednesday, highlighting that Sleepy Joe is now at 46 percent support, while a week ago, the same poll had Biden at 48 percent.

The pollster pointed out that Biden is now at his lowest level of support in any of their surveys throughout the whole year.

Meanwhile, President Trump’s support increased from 44% last week to 45%, closing the gap to just one point, where it was four points a week ago.

“The new survey finds Biden with 76% of the Democratic vote. Trump has the support of 77% of Republicans.” Rasmussen notes, adding that “The candidates are tied among voters not affiliated with either major political party.”



As riots and unrest continue to dominate the headlines, a new poll has found that almost as many American voters now view violent crime as an important election issue compared to coronavirus, something that is likely to help President Trump.

Even leftists admitted that last week’s DNC was so monumentally awful, that it actually gave President Trump a boost in approval numbers:

Rasmussen earlier noted that they “triple-checked” the numbers and found that Trump’s job approval is “up sharply”:

The city is deploying several thousand police around the German capital this weekend, citing threats.

The German city notably did not ban a June Black Lives Matter protest in which approximately 15,000 people turned out.

Meanwhile, the Assembly for Freedom had 17,000 registered demonstrators for the August 29 event before Berlin shut it down.



Now it all makes sense.

“We are still in the middle of a pandemic with rising infection figures,” said Berlin Interior Minister, Andreas Geisel. “This is not a decision against freedom of assembly, but a decision in favor of infection protection,” he continued, adding that Berlin should not be “misused as a stage for corona deniers… and right-wing extremists.”

About 20,000 people, including libertarians, constitutional loyalists, far-right supporters and anti-vaccination activists, marched in Berlin on Aug. 1. Geisel said the organisers of that protest had deliberately broken rules they had previously agreed with police, including wearing masks and maintaining social distancing. “Such behaviour is not acceptable. The state cannot be given the runaround,” he said, adding he did not want Berlin to be a stage for conspiracy theorists and right-wing extremists. –Reuters

Meanwhile, Germany’s right-wing Alternative for Germany (AfD) has called for a protest at the Brandenburg Gate against the ban.

“The Senate is trampling on fundamental rights,” AfD said in a statement.

Users who wanted to donate to the page were greeted by a message that read “We’re sorry, but that campaign cannot be found.”

In contrast, the GoFundMe page for Black Lives Matter rioters arrested by police in Portland has been allowed to accumulate over $1.3 million in donations.

Other pages asking for bail money for jailed rioters across the country have accumulated hundreds of thousands of dollars.

Harrison Smith joins the War Room to breakdown the shootings in Kenosha, Wisconsin moment-by-moment. Using video of the event to establish a complete timeline, it becomes clear that this shooting was the inevitable consequence of the lawlessness being permitted to terrorize American cities. The GoFundMe page for Jacob Blake, the convicted child sex offender whose shooting by police sparked the violent riots in Kenosha, has accrued a massive nest egg of $1.6 million. George Floyd’s family GoFundMe page has racked up the staggering sum of $14.7 million, in contrast to the $800,000 raised for 5-year-old murder victim Cannon Hinnant as reported on earlier this month by National File: Though a slight increase in media coverage has brought more attention to the murder of 5-year-old white boy Cannon Hinnant over the past week, the national response is still exceedingly disproportionate compared to the national mourning and violence that followed the death of convicted felon George Floyd this summer. A Justice for Cannon Hinnant fundraiser page has been set up on GoFundMe, and at press time has accrued roughly $770,000 in donations. The spike in donations over the week is due in no small part to the hashtag #SayHisName, which went viral on social media despite a media blackout. By contrast, the GoFundMe for George Floyd has amassed a staggering $14.7 million in payouts for the Floyd family, and payments continue to pour in. In addition, a mobile hologram that traces Floyd’s name and visage in the sky with garish yellow lighting is slated to tour the United States, replacing historical monuments. Rittenhouse has been charged with first degree homicide, a charge which does not seem to align with the factual account of the shooting as revealed by overwhelming exculpatory video evidence.

The viral shooting came at a time when police brutality scandals have entered the public sphere and race relations were mired by a summer of violence following the in-custody death of suspected fraudster George Floyd.

The statement begins by recalling the events leading up to the shooting when police were called out to a home disturbance.

“During the incident, officers attempted to arrest Jacob S. Blake, age 29. Law enforcement deployed a taser to attempt to stop Mr. Blake, however the taser was not successful in stopping Mr. Blake. Mr. Blake walked around his vehicle, opened the driver’s side door, and leaned forward,” the statement read. “While holding onto Mr. Blake’s shirt, Officer Rusten Sheskey fired his service weapon 7 times. Officer Sheskey fired the weapon into Mr. Blake’s back. No other officer fired their weapon. Kenosha Police Department does not have body cameras, therefore the officers were not wearing body cameras.” “The shooting officer, Kenosha Police Officer Rusten Sheskey, has been a law enforcement officer with Kenosha Police Department for seven years,” the statement added. “During the investigation following the initial incident, Mr. Blake admitted that he had a knife in his possession. DCI agents recovered a knife from the driver’s side floorboard of Mr. Blake’s vehicle. A search of the vehicle located no additional weapons.” The shooting triggered violent protests that saw businesses burned, officers attacked, and fatal shootings as some spun a narrative suggesting Blake may have been unarmed when he was shot. “Law enforcement immediately provided medical aid to Mr. Blake. Flight for Life transported Mr. Blake to Froedtert Hospital in Milwaukee. Mr. Blake remains at the hospital,” the Wisconsin DOJ wrote. “DCI is leading this investigation and is assisted by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Wisconsin State Patrol and Kenosha County Sheriff’s Office. All involved law enforcement are fully cooperating with DCI during this investigation. The involved officers have been placed on administrative leave.” “DCI is continuing to review evidence and determine the facts of this incident and will turn over investigative reports to a prosecutor following a complete and thorough investigation,” the statement continued. National File recently reported on a similar story in Pennsylvania, where uncooperative suspects walked away from officers and retreated to their vehicles, only to open fire on police immediately after. Three officers were wounded in the incident.

The “protesters” yesterday acted as though they were all innocent victims.

“The Pennsylvania State Police (PSP) Troop G Bedford station was contacted by a property owner on Monday, August 24 at 11:18 p.m. regarding a group of people in a private business parking lot. Troopers later learned the group was comprised of approximately 30 activists who are traveling on foot and in vehicles from Milwaukee, Wisconsin to Washington, D.C. At approximately 11:35 p.m. at the same location and before state police arrival, the property owners confronted the activists. The confrontation escalated, and gunshots were exchanged between the property owners and the activists,” police said, as quoted by WTAE.

“One of the activists was struck by birdshot from a shotgun. The man was treated and released from the Conemaugh Memorial Medical Center, 1086 Franklin Street Johnstown, Pennsylvania,” police said.

“A shotgun, shotgun shells, a semi-automatic pistol and 9mm casings were all recovered at the scene.”

No wonder the “victims” didn’t want their identities known!

Police are still investigating and say no one has been charged at this time but charges may come at a later date.

Meanwhile, the roaming mob of “protesters” were involved in another shooting on Tuesday evening in the parking lot of a hotel in Bedford.

As I documented yesterday, there is plenty of evidence to suggest these “protesters” may be armed illegally.

Police need to stop this mob and demand to see their firearms licenses before anyone else gets hurt!

316,https://www.infowars.com/2020-election-nightmare-armies-of-lawyers-are-ready-to-fight-a-long-legal-battle-over-the-election-results/,2020-08-27T09:44:57,infowars,"Armies of lawyers have already been recruited, reasons to question the legitimacy of the 2020 election results are already being floated, and top politicians on both sides are already urging a fight to the bitter end.

Initially, it appeared that we might avoid this sort of a scenario.

For several months Joe Biden had a large lead in all of the major national polls, and some people were even discussing the possibility of a “landslide”.

But now the polls are tightening up, and this is especially true in the swing states which will ultimately decide the outcome of the election.



Alex Jones breaks down the Left’s plans to subvert the election and overthrow the office of the President to seize control of the government from the people.

If the race is quite tight once we get to election night, it is likely that neither side will be willing to concede until every conceivable legal challenge is completely exhausted.

That could mean an extended legal battle lasting for months, and that is something that none of us should want to see.

But it appears that such an outcome could be quite likely. In fact, former FEC chair Michael Toner is warning that the 2020 election could potentially be “Bush v. Gore on steroids”…

The November presidential election is poised to become the most litigated vote in recent U.S. history, according to a former federal election honcho. “The 2020 election might be Bush v. Gore on steroids,” said Michael Toner, a former chairman of the Federal Election Commission and former chief counsel at the Republican National Committee.

I don’t like the sound of that at all.

When that election happened, I was actually going to law school down in Florida, and it was complete and utter madness.

In the end, Bush’s legal team was superior to Gore’s, and that may have made all the difference.

This time around, both sides have recruited “armies of volunteer lawyers” in the key battleground states…

President Trump and presumptive Democratic nominee Joseph R. Biden’s campaigns have enlisted armies of volunteer lawyers in battleground states and swing districts to fight out close calls on Election Day. Both sides have already filed multiple lawsuits.

The Biden campaign has been particularly aggressive in rounding up lawyers. At one point, Biden bragged that his campaign had already recruited 600 lawyers…

Joe Biden’s campaign is assembling hundreds of lawyers nationwide to monitor potential voting issues as part of its extensive voter protection efforts heading into the general election. Speaking at a virtual fundraiser Wednesday, the presumptive Democratic nominee said his team has organized 600 lawyers and others across the country to “try to figure out why the chicanery is likely to take place.”

One of the fastest ways to ruin anything is to get lawyers involved.

I was once a lawyer, and so I know what I am talking about.

And I have a feeling that this election will end up in the hands of the lawyers after election night. I do not believe that either side is going to be willing to concede if the results are remotely close, and earlier this week Hillary Clinton actually said that Joe Biden should not concede “under any circumstances”…

“Joe Biden should not concede under any circumstances because I think this is going to drag out, and eventually I do believe he will win if we don’t give an inch and if we are as focused and relentless as the other side is,” Clinton said in an excerpt posted Tuesday.

That certainly sounds quite ominous.

On multiple occasions, President Trump has also indicated that he may challenge the outcome of the election, and one of the biggest things that he is concerned about are mail-in ballots. The following is what he told “Fox and Friends” not too long ago…

“Now with that being said, I have to tell you that if you go with this universal mail-in, where you send millions of votes–in California tens of millions of ballots being sent to everybody and their dogs, okay? Dogs are getting them, okay? People that have been dead for 25 years are getting them–you have to see what’s happening. Then you’re never going to have a fair election.”

In this case, I think that Trump has a very legitimate point.

In some states, millions of mail-in ballots are being sent out to voters whether the voters request them or not. That opens a door for all sorts of potential vote fraud, and this is something that alarms me greatly.

In this election, every single vote in the battleground states is going to matter, and the integrity of the voting process is of paramount importance.

At first, Joe Biden had built up impressive leads in many of the most important swing states, but now those leads are deteriorating. Just check out the following numbers that pollster Frank Luntz just posted on Twitter…

Swing state polls on August 25th: Pennsylvania • 2016: Hillary +9.2 • 2020: Biden +5.7 Michigan • 2016: Hillary +9.0 • 2020: Biden +6.7 Wisconsin • 2016: Hillary +11.5 • 2020: Biden +6.5 Florida • 2016: Hillary +2.9 • 2020: Biden +4.8

Those numbers should definitely set off alarm bells for Democrats.

And today Real Clear Politics has posted four new battleground polls that show how much the race is shifting. One poll shows Biden up by only 3 points in Florida, another has him up by only 2 points in Arizona, a third has him up by only 1 point in North Carolina, and a fourth poll actually has Trump up by 1 point in Wisconsin.

Trump was definitely not supposed to win Wisconsin this time around, and so that should definitely be freaking Democrats out.

So why are the polls moving in Trump’s direction?

Well, it appears that all of the violence that is going on around the country is backfiring on the Democrats in a major way. Trump is perceived to be the “law and order candidate”, and Biden is making a massive political mistake by not strongly speaking out against the riots that are happening on a nightly basis.

According to one recent survey, 59 percent of voters say that violent crime is a “very important” factor in deciding who to vote for…

The bedlam is now reflected in the polls, with Americans becoming increasingly concerned about law and order. “A sizable 59 percent of voters in the survey indicate that violent crime, which President Trump has framed as happening in Democrat-controlled cities, is a ‘very important’ factor in casting their ballots,” writes Rusty Weiss.

And Zogby Analytics has just released new numbers that seem to show that the chaos in our major cities is helping Trump significantly…

“As violent protests and violent crime continue to spike in cities like Chicago, Milwaukee New York City, and Portland, Trump’s standing with urban voters in large cities (59% at least somewhat approved/38% at least somewhat disapproved), and small cities (51% at least somewhat approved/49% at least somewhat disapproved) continues to climb higher.”

It truly is ironic what we are witnessing. All of these protesters think that they are promoting the cause of “social justice”, but their actions may be giving us four more years of Trump instead.

At this point, even CNN’s Don Lemon is realizing that Joe Biden’s inaction on these issues is moving the poll numbers…

“That’s all you. This is where I come in. We’ll get to that. But when you said it’s too little too late, I don’t know about that. I mean, we still have a lot of time left until election day. I do think that this —what you said was happening in Kenosha is a Rorschach test for the entire country. I think this is a blind spot for Democrats. I think Democrats are hoping this will go away, and it’s not going to go away.” “I think maybe Joe Biden may be afraid to do it. I’m not sure. Maybe he won’t, maybe he is. He’s got to address it. He’s got to come out and talk about it. He’s got to do a speech like Barack Obama did about race. He’s got to come out and tell people that he’s going to deal with the issue of police reform in this country, and that’s what’s happening now is happening under Donald Trump’s watch. When he is the president, Kamala Harris is the vice president. Then they will take care of this problem. But guess what? The rioting has to stop. Chris, as you know, and I know it’s showing up in the polling, it’s showing up in focus groups. It is the only thing right now that is sticking.“

If the election had been held a couple of months ago, Joe Biden probably would have won by a large margin, but now everything is changing.

At this point it appears that we could have a very tight election with legal challenges that could last for months afterwards. If such a scenario plays out, that could definitely set the stage for the sort of civil unrest that I warn about in my new book.

Could you imagine the national temper tantrum that we would see if Trump has a very, very narrow lead after election night?

Of course the left will pull out every legal trick in the book in order to try to deny Trump a second term, and Trump has his own army of lawyers ready to fight back.

I have a feeling that things are going to get very, very ugly, and that is extremely unfortunate.

As far as the accusation goes, Melania Trump has never engaged in prostitution, and sued the British tabloid the Daily Mail in 2016 after accusing her of being a sex worker during the 1990s.

“The newspaper agreed to pay damages and apologised to the First Lady in April 2017,” reported the BBC.

Interestingly, it’s been theorized the very photo used by Cardi B to attack the First Lady may have been leaked by her husband, then-candidate Donald Trump, during the run-up to the 2016 presidential election.

Governors Andrew Cuomo of New York, Phil Murphy of New Jersey, Tom Wolf of Pennsylvania and Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan were each given two weeks to comply.

“Today the Justice Department requested COVID-19 data from the governors of states that issued orders which may have resulted in the deaths of thousands of elderly nursing home residents,” reads the Wednesday press release. “New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Michigan required nursing homes to admit COVID-19 patients to their vulnerable populations, often without adequate testing.”

“The Department of Justice’s Civil Rights Division is evaluating whether to initiate investigations under the federal ‘Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act’ (CRIPA), which protects the civil rights of persons in state-run nursing homes, among others. The Civil Rights Division seeks to determine if the state orders requiring admission of COVID-19 patients to nursing homes is responsible for the deaths of nursing home residents.”

Assistant Attorney General Eric Dreiband of the DoJ’s Civil Rights Division made it clear to each governor that they must provide documents and information for each public nursing home and the data provided should be on a “Public Nursing Home-specific basis for each Public Nursing Home in the state.”

“Protecting the rights of some of society’s most vulnerable members, including elderly nursing home residents, is one of our country’s most important obligations,” said Dreiband. “We must ensure they are adequately cared for with dignity and respect and not unnecessarily put at risk.”

A pair of underage boys were discovered naked and badly beaten in a cemetery in Solna, Sweden, on Sunday morning.

“The boys, who were found undressed in a cemetery, are said to have been subjected to a torture-like assault that lasted a large part of the night,” Aftonbladet reports.

The victims were transported to a local hospital, where they revealed to police they had been kidnapped the previous night and brutalized for hours.

“Two men have been arrested on suspicion of aggravated assault of two victims of crime discovered by passersby in a cemetery,” Swedish police wrote in a statement.

The suspects are both adult males in their 20s, one from Iran and the other of Tunisian descent.

Both men are reportedly known to police and have previous criminal convictions.

“One of the perpetrators is a 21-year-old man, born in Iran, who came to Sweden as a child in 2009. He has since been convicted of repeated crimes in Sweden,” Fria Tider reports. “As recently as last month, he was sentenced to one-and-a-half years in prison for arson for having set fire to sports cars parked in Gustavsberg on Värmdö east of Stockholm in December last year.”

“He has previously also been convicted of, among other things, theft, illegal driving, drunk driving and minor drug offenses. It is currently unclear why he was at large because he is to be in prison according to the latest verdict against him.”

The other suspect, aged 18, is the son of Tunisian immigrants and also holds a criminal record.

“Among other things, he was taken into care as a 12-year-old according to the Act on the Care of Young People (LVU) and was convicted in March last year of attempted theft. With the help of DNA, the 18-year-old was linked to a burglary at Granbackaskolan in Solna on New Year's Day 2018,” Fria Tider reports.

Arrest hearings for both men are set to take place this week, according to Solna District Court.

323,https://www.infowars.com/roger-stone-exclusive-senate-intelligence-report-on-russia-a-criminal-fraud/,2020-08-26T21:17:54,infowars,"With its publication this week of a tedious, picayune 966-page “report” rehashing the long-since-collapsed ‘Russian collusion’ false narrative, the Senate “Intelligence” Committee joins its discredited House counterpart as another powerful public body co-opted by cynical partisan manipulators as an illegitimate tool to inflict political damage, if not personal destruction, on their most effective adversaries.

The ‘report’ is nothing but a naked presidential election year ploy, attempting to resuscitate one of the most vile of all malicious political frauds ever perpetrated on a sitting president and the people of this country.

This repackaged redux of the repeatedly-debunked Russian collusion smear is clearly the handiwork of the committee’s de facto chairman (though his title is vice-chairman) Senator Mark Warner, a slippery demagogic partisan politician who has proven to be one of the most odious and manipulative of all rabid Trump antagonists in Congress. Warner rivals the execrable liar-leaker Adam Schiff in his penchant for deceitful grandstanding and underhanded partisan abuse of congressional oversight authority.

Since the committee’s Republicans are decidedly of the RINO/Neocon variety, with nominal chair and GOP quisling Richard Burr now under FBI investigation for insider trading around the coronavirus scare, the Senate’s report concludes the exact opposite of the report issued by the House Intelligence Committee under Chairman Devin Nunes, in the last Congress.

The coordinated media roll-out of this report, complete with faux-serious statements of ‘grave concern’ and similarly-contrived alarmist fulminations made to eager anti-Trump media cameras by the committee’s partisan Democrat concern trolls, defeats any presumptions of good faith public interested motives behind its release just weeks from the imminent re-election of President Trump.

The recycled, long-debunked garbage being pushed in the report has long passed it’s sell-by date, yet they can’t resist another effort to push their “BIG LIE” as it concerns me. The report says, “[t]he Committee assessed that Trump spoke with Stone about WikiLeaks on multiple occasions,” despite the fact that the president said in written answers to the Mueller gang that he did not recall doing so. This ‘assessment’ is flatly, unequivocally and 100% FALSE.

Notice the report’s convenient use of the hedge word “assessed”. This particularly-unpersuasive word choice is used by intelligence agencies when they seek to push some conclusion for which they have NO evidence or proof, as is the case with their manufactured claim that I ever once communicated with President Trump about WikiLeaks.

I testified to the House Intelligence Committee that I had NOT spoken to candidate Trump or President Trump about the Wikileaks disclosures. The charges brought against me for false statements to that committee did NOT include my testimony refuting any claims that I had ever had such communications with Donald Trump. Further, the Mueller Report never alleged, or otherwise concluded, that the President was not truthful when he likewise said he recalled no such communications.

Aggressive as they were, even the Mueller prosecutors knew full well that the only support they could muster to substantiate this fabricated claim was uncorroborated testimony from Michael Cohen and Rick Gates, induced as part of their plea bargains, attempting to avoid prison. Even after seizing all of my communications and devices, and presumably surveilling those of others, perhaps even the President’s, not a single text, email, note or other document was found or produced to contradict the truth that both the President and I told about this question.

The report also conveniently excludes Cohen’s contradictory testimony on this point. Cohen first said he overheard a call between candidate Trump and me in July of 2016 just before the Democrat National Convention, during which WikiLeaks dropped the first batch of DNC-related documents. Then he changed his story, subsequently claiming he overheard this call in August 2016, just before the Republican National Convention.

Cohen’s perjured testimony claimed that candidate Trump put me on speaker phone, after a secretary told him I was on the line. The secretary who routinely handled any calls I made to candidate Trump gave no support to Cohen’s claims – namely because Cohen’s version of events never happened. Cohen was never called as a witness in my trial, and for good reason – the claims of this admitted liar have ZERO corroboration.

Curiously, the only other testimony purporting that Donald Trump and I communicated about Wikileaks – from Rick Gates – was essentially an identical circumstance, as though the “overhearing a phone call” scenario was the only one that the Mueller gang and their two cooperating plea-bargainers could plausibly fabricate, knowing they had not an iota of hard evidence (a text, email, recording, note etc). Rick Gates testified at my trial that he witnessed Trump take a cell phone call from me while riding with candidate Trump in a SUV from Trump Tower to LaGuardia Airport in August 2016.

Gates admitted he did not hear the actual call, claiming only that he knew it was a call from me because he purportedly saw my name pop up on Trump’s cell phone. The fact that Gates was seated in the back of SUV, while Trump rode in the front seat, casts doubt on this claim, and Gates never explained how he could have so readily glimpsed anything on Trump’s phone, in the instant Trump would have looked down at the phone and picked up the call, putting the phone up to his ear.

Further, I’ve had the same cell phone number for many years and it has always been held under my company, which is what pops up from Caller ID whenver I call someone from it, i.e. even if Gates somehow could see the screen, it would not have displayed my name.

Gates also said there were two Secret Service Agents in the car at the time, but conveniently for Gates and his fictional testimony, the Government could not produce them, nor could it even produce a phone record to show such a call ever happened. Gates claimed that he knew the call pertained to Wikileaks because of something Trump said immediately after the call, but then claimed elsewhere that Trump’s comment was made much later, after they had boarded Trump’s plane.

The bottom line is that Gates’ fictional overheard call between candidate Trump and me simply never happened. But Gates got what he needed in exchange for fabricating a conveniently “overheard call” (which no one else apparently overheard): a mere 45-day sentence and a free pass from the Mueller gang on a million dollar tax evasion charge. Regardless, Gates’s tall tale, like Cohen’s, is uncorroborated – the result of an extremely-desirable benefit accruing to Gates: avoiding serious prison time.

These two fabricated, uncorroborated plea bargain-induced stories of supposed eavesdropping (without actually hearing anything) are regularly used to bolster the BIG LIE. The BIG LIE goes like this: Roger Stone traded his silence regarding his knowledge of misconduct by the president in return for the president’s commutation of his sentence.”

What makes this defamatory falsehood especially underhanded and malicious is that it was concocted out of my public statements that I would never trade false testimony against the president instigated from me by the Special Counsel lawyers for some sort of prosecutorial leniency or plea deal from Mueller.

When I repeatedly and accurately said that Mueller‘s dirty cops attempted to pressure me into bearing false witness against the president, but that I flatly refused and further said that I would never do so, the Democrat disinformation spinmeisters deceitfully twisted this into an insinuation that I somehow secured clemency by my refusal to implicate Donald Trump. Funny they express no concern, or even merely acknowledge it as real possibility, that doing so would require my testifying falsely.

As the Trump-deranged Democrats and their media propagandists have shown over and over and over, there is no lie or fabrication they would ever decry or condemn or even deem wrong, as long as it is harmful in any way to Donald Trump. Conversely, there is no truth, no matter how incontrovertible or obvious, that they will ever accept, as long as it affirms or validates Donald Trump, or more precisely if it in any contradicts their militant, seeting hatred and utterly-warped villainization towards him.

One need not look past the players behind this disinformation campaign concerning my refusal to testify to Special Counsel-induced lies about the president to see this derangement in its fullest expression. The warped originator of it is Andrew Weissman, who now can be seen regularly spouting outright Trump hate on MSNBC, just another zealot among its malignant peanut gallery of arrogant pseudo-intellects. Weissmann’s bull was then picked up and repeated by Adam (bull)Schiff, and eventually by those paragons of truth and integrity Jerry Nadler, Hillary Clinton and Eric Swalwell. Its bogus recycling by the Senate Intelligence committee is just the latest ploy to sandbag their BIG LIE with yet another worthless D.C. establishment paper blizzard.

With the top tier disinformation peddlers giving them their cues, the second and third stringers then pile on to repeat and reinforce the lie. This was evident when suddenly dozens of leftist law professors, attorneys and legal “experts” popped up with half-baked op-eds pushing the same crackpot theory: “the President’s commutation of Stone’s sentence was tainted because Trump was acting to hide his own misconduct”. Their legal contortions and deceitful distortions of the facts, like their conclusions, are simply WRONG.

The president commuted my sentence as an act of both justice and mercy. He believed, with plenty of factual and legal support in plain view for all to see, that I did not get a fair trial. He also saw that, contrary to judicial precedent in every district in the US court system and contrary to the current policy of the DOJ/BOP, I was being ordered to surrender at 67 years old and with asthma to a federal correctional facility that had substantial numbers of confirmed COVID-19 cases. He realized that this “special (mis) treatment” amount to essentially a death sentence. These were more than enough to warrant his clemency, and his act of clemency had nothing whatsoever to do with some exchange for my “silence”, a deal that exists only in the fevered, malicious imaginations of Trump (or Stone) haters.



Howard Fineman of MSNBC even tried to get into the act, claiming I had somehow earned clemency by remaining silent, based on a telephone conversation with me. Of course, the duplicitous MSNBC has-been tried to justify himself in a text message to me saying that he never intended to make such a claim, admitting it was not consistent with our conversation. This little episode with Fineman was reported by the Gateway Pundit.

As an exercise in overkill, the Senate Intelligence Committee report includes 1098 references to me in either the body of the report or the footnotes, with virtually all of them incorrect, including this whopper: “In July 2016, Stone drafted tweets for Trump — at his request — that “attacked Clinton for her adversarial posture toward Russia and mentioned a new peace deal with Putin.” It is beyond even my imagination to conceive who would have made this claim because I wrote no tweets for Donald Trump, including the one referred to here.

The phony Senate Intel report also asserted that “[t]he committee also found “significant evidence” to suggest that WikiLeaks was “knowingly collaborating with Russian government officials.” They must have lost it after they “found” such evidence, because it has yet to be forthcoming, from this committee or anywhere else. WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has long denied, quite vigorously, that the source of the hacked emails was Russia. In fact, Assange has further stated with equal vigor that the source was not any state or state agent at all.

The committee’s loose smear of Wikileaks as some Russian stooge is simply reverse engineered from the desired conclusion they began their investigation with, as their guiding foundation – the dubious presumption that “the Russians hacked the DNC and used Wikileaks to disseminate the stolen data”. The problem with this little chestnut is that declassified documents now prove that this claim has literally no basis whatsoever other than a draft redacted memo that Crowdstrike prepared for the DNC, a memo which Crowdstrikes’ own executives have now debunked in sworn testimony.

Taking a step back from all this hair-splitting spin and disinformation, dressed-up as some sort of objective, non-(or “bi”)-partisan Senate investigation, the political landscape provides the real context for this presidential election-eve stunt. It is all too clear that there is now an impending unraveling of the Obama-Clinton-Biden illegal political spying operation conducted against presidential candidate Donald Trump in 2016 and carried over by the same subversives against President of the United States Donald Trump, well into 2017.

It is the ensuing collapse of this corrupt house of cards spying scheme, which involved truly criminal – seditious – misconduct by top Obama administration officials that has prompted this last ditch effort to salvage the spectacular public flop that was the 2-year multi-million dollar rogue “Special Counsel” witch hunt lynch mob conducted against President Trump’s political allies by legal mercenaries handpicked from the Obama-Clinton-Biden cesspool of Democrat lawyers.

These corrupt players know that their crimes are too large to forever be obscured by all of the exaggerated hysteria and deceitful mischaracterizations they have spent years peddling about legal opposition efforts to expose the truth about their epically-corrupt presidential wannabe and her endlessly-sleazy retinue of partisan hacks and hatchetweasels.

The fact is that, for all their endless, breathless media hyping to bolster its credibility and justify its meandering secretive crusade, the “Special Counsel” operation was only fronted by its incessantly-lionized figurehead Robert Mueller. Behind the file footage Mueller facade it was actually run by corrupt partisan Democrat lawyer Andrew Weissmann, It was not “Republican war hero” Mueller, but sleazy Democrat errand boy Weissmann who marshaled a rat’s nest of Obama-Clinton loyalists to pose as prosecutors, spending nearly two years targeting a small group of key advisors and supporters of Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign.

With nearly-unlimited investigative resources at its disposal, a small army of malicious Democrat partisan lawyers making up its ranks, and effectively no actual oversight or adult supervision from the “acting” Attorney General or any other sufficiently-empowered official within the DOJ, Weissmann and his flunkies perpetrated an “investigation” that three months into its existence had already established conclusively that there was, in fact, no “Russian collusion” and zero criminal predicates to justify the promulgation of any prosecutions against anyone associated with Donald Trump’s wildly-successful presidential campaign.

Not ones to be deterred by the non-existence of any crimes they could prosecute in connection with Donald Trump’s spectacular pummeling of their political godmother, the Weissmann vendetta operation persisted with general warrant style targeting of select high-profile targets associated with the 2016 Trump Campaign, notably only individuals who had not become federal government employees in the wake of the Democrat-career-shattering Trump triumph.

After a full year of coming up short in their quest to settle the score for their failed would-be political patroness, while also providing cover to their corrupt cronies who criminally abused extraordinary spying powers against the current president at the behest of his predecessor (their now-fading political messiah) the imperative to manufacture any sort of malicious prosecution they could grew more and more acute.

Even if it meant finally conceding that there was absolutely nothing they could contort or contrive out of the Trump Campaign’s activities sufficient to manufacture a criminal case to slake their vengeance through some abusive prosecution, the Special Counsel Weissmann gang was bound and determined to lynch them at least one high-profile Trump Republican. That turned out to be me.

As a last resort they set about to backtrack with a fine-tooth-comb through the course of the larger “Russia! Russia!! Russia!!!” witch hunt, of which they were but one terror cell, to cherry pick any sort of process offense they could possibly extract from its mindless, fruitless consumption of public resources and airtime. Or perhaps they could exaggerate and sensationalize some fleeting inconsequential circumstance unearthed from somewhere in their dragnet haul of private communications from one of their preferred targets that could be shoehorned to fit the elements of some criminal offense.

Whatever their tactics were to cobble together any sort of criminal offenses they could possibly contrive to prop up their phony ulterior-motivated crusade to substantiate their partisan fantasies of busting up some Russian collusion conspiracy, in the end their Russian collusion conspiracy theory was just that – a pure fantasy.

Now, the thinnest residue leftover from the Special Counsel’s spectacularly-failed attempt to justify its rogue existence has been meticulously cataloged and deceitfully inflated into huge chunks of a 966-page Senate Intelligence Committee exercise in generating sheafs of written material having such profound credibility and relevance that it warrants immediate and wholesale consignment to the circular file.

In sum, for all its meticulous organization the committee’s report is merely a more voluminous regurgitation of the same tortured insinuations and deceitful evidentiary spin that this committee’s equally-compromised predecessors spent more than three years manufacturing from behind the fraudulent facade of a legitimate meritorious investigation.

The Democrat Russian collusion conspiracy theorists on the Senate Intelligence Committee are clearly eager to squander whatever vestigial credibility still attached to their august body from a long-gone era in which it was not so easily degenerated into a cheap tool of even cheaper partisan gameplaying.

What is obvious from this latest iteration in the disingenuous pursuit of mythical Russian boogeymen presumed to have colluded somehow with Donald Trump and his campaign in 2016, is that it bears the same illegitimate ulterior motives as other previous Russian collusion witch hunts.

Their first motive is to distract the public’s attention and divert political heat away from the real corruption and the real Russian collusion that Democrat politicians and operatives had perpetrated both during and after the 2016 election.

Their second motive is to damage and defame President Trump and his associates by any means necessary, until he is driven from office.

The third motive, though it is rather moot this far down-sewer, is to establish false pretexts to obtain warrants, or some other legal justification, to surveil, search and seize the sensitive political and personal communications of targeted adversaries.

In the final analysis, this committee’s report stands as an officious attempt to prop up the runny pile of political mud that is the sum total substance of the Obama-Clinton-Biden junta’s multi-year attempt to gaslight the American public in order to wage a ruthless malicious smear campaign against a sitting president.

If nothing else, this report provides a detailed compendium of the elaborate disinformation that was contrived and propagated by corrupt Obama administration officials and Clinton-loyal apparatchiks, who effectively acted as partisan political operatives while holding sworn positions in federal law enforcement and in the intelligence “community.”

These are the sort of serious, brazen crimes that don’t require a two-year $30M fine tooth comb job by partisan pencil pushers, nor a 966-page report, to be taken seriously…and vigorously prosecuted like the grotesque betrayals of trust and abuses of power they represent.

325,https://www.infowars.com/study-rules-out-dark-matter-destruction-as-origin-of-extra-radiation-in-galaxy-center/,2020-08-26T20:22:18,infowars,"The detection more than a decade ago by the Fermi Gamma Ray Space Telescope of an excess of high-energy radiation in the center of the Milky Way convinced some physicists that they were seeing evidence of the annihilation of dark matter particles, but a team led by researchers at the University of California, Irvine has ruled out that interpretation.

In a paper published recently in the journal Physical Review D, the UCI scientists and colleagues at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University and other institutions report that—through an analysis of the Fermi data and an exhaustive series of modeling exercises—they were able to determine that the observed gamma rays could not have been produced by what are called weakly interacting massive particles, most popularly theorized as the stuff of dark matter.

By eliminating these particles, the destruction of which could generate energies of up to 300 giga-electron volts, the paper’s authors say, they have put the strongest constraints yet on dark matter properties.

“For 40 years or so, the leading candidate for dark matter among particle physicists was a thermal, weakly interacting and weak-scale particle, and this result for the first time rules out that candidate up to very high-mass particles,” said co-author Kevork Abazajian, UCI professor of physics & astronomy.

“In many models, this particle ranges from 10 to 1,000 times the mass of a proton, with more massive particles being less attractive theoretically as a dark matter particle,” added co-author Manoj Kaplinghat, also a UCI professor of physics & astronomy. “In this paper, we’re eliminating dark matter candidates over the favored range, which is a huge improvement in the constraints we put on the possibilities that these are representative of dark matter.”

Abazajian said that dark matter signals could be crowded out by other astrophysical phenomena in the Galactic Center—such as star formation, cosmic ray deflection off molecular gas and, most notably, neutron stars and millisecond pulsars—as sources of excess gamma rays detected by the Fermi space telescope.

“We looked at all of the different modeling that goes on in the Galactic Center, including molecular gas, stellar emissions and high-energy electrons that scatter low-energy photons,” said co-author Oscar Macias, a postdoctoral scholar in physics and astronomy at the Kavli Institute for the Physics and Mathematics of the Universe at the University of Tokyo whose visit to UCI in 2017 initiated this project. “We took over three years to pull all of these new, better models together and examine the emissions, finding that there is little room left for dark matter.”

Macias, who is also a postdoctoral researcher with the GRAPPA Centre at the University of Amsterdam, added that this result would not have been possible without data and software provided by the Fermi Large Area Telescope collaboration.

The group tested all classes of models used in the Galactic Center region for excess emission analyses, and its conclusions remained unchanged. “One would have to craft a diffuse emission model that leaves a big ‘hole’ in them to relax our constraints, and science doesn’t work that way,” Macias said.

Kaplinghat noted that physicists have predicted that radiation from dark matter annihilation would be represented in a neat spherical or elliptical shape emanating from the Galactic Center, but the gamma ray excess detected by the Fermi space telescope after its June 2008 deployment shows up as a triaxial, bar-like structure.

“If you peer at the Galactic Center, you see that the stars are distributed in a boxy way,” he said. “There’s a disk of stars, and right in the center, there’s a bulge that’s about 10 degrees on the sky, and it’s actually a very specific shape—sort of an asymmetric box—and this shape leaves very little room for additional dark matter.”

Does this research rule out the existence of dark matter in the galaxy? “No,” Kaplinghat said. “Our study constrains the kind of particle that dark matter could be. The multiple lines of evidence for dark matter in the galaxy are robust and unaffected by our work.”

Far from considering the team’s findings to be discouraging, Abazajian said they should encourage physicists to focus on concepts other than the most popular ones.

“There are a lot of alternative dark matter candidates out there,” he said. “The search is going to be more like a fishing expedition where you don’t already know where the fish are.”

326,https://www.infowars.com/economist-weak-economy-driving-strong-housing-market/,2020-08-26T20:01:09,infowars,"New home sales blew away expectations in July, coming in at the highest level since 2006. A lot of people take this as a sign of a strengthening economy. Peter Schiff begs to differ. In his podcast, he argued that surging homes sales are actually a sign of a weak economy.

Single-family new home sales rose 14% between June and July to an annual rate of 901,000, according to Commerce Department data. Sales were up 36% on a yearly basis.

This comes on the heels of a 24.7% spike in existing home sales, according to National Realtors Association data that came out last week.

As Peter pointed out in his podcast, you have to go back to housing bubble days to find a bigger month for new home sales. Is this because the economy is booming right now?

“No. It’s got nothing to do with a booming economy. In fact, one of the reasons so many new homes are being bought is because the economy is so weak that mortgage rates are down at two-and-a-half percent.”

There is also a dark side in the housing market that is not being discussed. Even as people buy houses, many more are in danger of losing theirs. The overall delinquency rate for mortgages on one-to-four-unit residential properties spiked by nearly 4% in Q2, reaching 8.22% as of June 30, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association’s National Delinquency Survey. The jump in the delinquency rate was the biggest quarterly rise in the history of the survey.

Wolf Street summed up the situation.

“This mess playing out in the mortgage market has been largely swept under the rug of widespread, government-supported forbearance programs – to where no one really knows what will happen to those mortgages when these forbearance programs end. And the exuberance in other parts of the real estate industry, such as with homebuilders, and even with mortgage brokers and mortgage lenders that arrange refi and purchase mortgages, is a contradiction to what is going on with these swept-under-rug delinquencies that will eventually come to a head.”

That contradiction is being fueled by Federal Reserve monetary policy. In effect, lenders are giving away money to buy homes. Keep in mind, you can still deduct mortgage interest from your income taxes. That means for those who itemize deductions, the net after-tax cost of the money will fall below 2%.

“That is below even the Fed’s official inflation rate. Now, the actual inflation rate is well north of that. But here, you could borrow money to buy a house for less than the annual inflation rate that we have now. … So, this is a great trade.”

Peter said the real loser in all of this will be the lenders – the banks. The government can guarantee mortgages so they will get paid. But the government can’t guarantee that the dollars used to repay that mortgage will have any real value.

So, what does this mean? If we’re going to load up American banks with 30-year mortgages at 2.5%, what happens when interest rates go up?

“We are setting up our financial system for a complete implosion. The banks are going to fail. Anybody that owns these mortgages — pension plans, endowments — this is going to be a complete disaster. Yes, it’s a windfall for the debtor, but it’s a disaster for the creditor. And a lot of Americans are creditors that don’t even know it. But our whole financial system is going to implode like a house of cards because of these low mortgages.”

Not only is the government guaranteeing mortgages, so is the Federal Reserve. The central bank is guaranteeing that you pay an insane, artificially low interest rate. So, even though home prices are rising to record levels and the cost of building new homes is rising as well, it doesn’t matter so much when you can borrow at 2.5%.

“And it’s only because the economy is lousy that you can get a mortgage this cheap, which is the only reason people are able to buy.”

Low mortgage rates are allowing people to buy homes, but that doesn’t explain why so many people are buying homes. Peter goes on to talk about that, saying they are moving out of the cities and high-tax states.

In this podcast, Peter also breaks down some more data revealing the economy isn’t rushing toward recovery and talked about the Fed’s Jackson Hole symposium.

328,https://www.infowars.com/study-fear-of-missing-out-impacts-people-of-all-ages/,2020-08-26T19:51:39,infowars,"Social media addicted teenagers are not the only people who experience the Fear of Missing Out also known as FoMO.

In fact, not age, but aspects of self-perception — namely loneliness, low self-esteem and low self-compassion — were more closely associated with the social anxiety that other people are having fun without you, according to a recent study by Washington State University researchers published in the Journal of Social and Personal Relationships.

“FoMO is not an adolescent or young adult problem, necessarily. It’s really about individual differences, irrespective of age,” said Chris Barry, a WSU psychology professor and the lead author on the study. “We expected FoMO to be higher in younger age groups, particularly because of the tremendous amount of social development happening at those times, but that’s not what we found.”

Barry and co-author Megan Wong, a WSU undergraduate student, conducted a survey of more than 400 people across the United States from different age cohorts ranging from 14 to 47, asking a range of questions related to self-perception, life satisfaction and social media use.

The researchers found that social media use was not a good predictor of FoMO. For instance, two people with the same social media engagement may be affected quite differently: one might have few negative feelings about seeing their friends’ activities while the other might find it upsetting.

“We’re not all equally prone to the Fear of Missing Out, but for those who are, social media can exacerbate it,” said Barry. “Social media allows you to witness what other people are doing and what’s going on in their lives. If there’s already concern about missing out, then there will be distress at seeing that on social media.”

For people experiencing this kind of distress, Barry suggested that it may be good to reduce social media use or cut it off altogether for a period of time.

The study did find one silver-lining: while FoMO can have negative impacts, it did not appear to relate to the respondents’ sense of life satisfaction. Barry said this indicates that FoMO is not an overwhelming social anxiety.

The researchers suggest that those who want to reduce their feelings of FoMO should try addressing their negative self-perceptions such as practicing better self-compassion by viewing personal setbacks as opportunities for growth, taking steps to reduce loneliness and shifting focus away from the distant experiences of others.

“To do something about FoMO, individuals can foster a greater sense of real connectedness to others which will lessen feelings of isolation. You can also try being more in the moment, concentrating on what is in front of you as opposed to focusing on what else is going on out there,” Barry said.

In a tweet Tuesday evening, King expressed frustration the department had not yet identified the officers seen on video shooting Blake as he refused to follow orders and reached into his vehicle.

“To the Kenosha Police Department,” King tweeted. “If you do not name the officer who brutally shot Jacob Blake on Sunday, we will simply begin naming officers from your department who may or may not be him.”

To the Kenosha Police Department, If you do not name the officer who brutally shot Jacob Blake on Sunday, we will simply begin naming officers from your department who may or may not be him. Fuck it.

“Fuck it,” he added. “Your protection of his identity is unethical. What’s his name?”

One reason the department could be delaying the release of the officers’ identities could be to protect them and their families from retribution.

King, dubbed “Talcum X” by some on social media due to his identifying as a black man even though he’s white, has been hot on the case of trying to find out the names of the officers.

King also asked Tuesday morning, “What’s the name of the officer who shot Jacob Blake?”

What’s the name of the officer who shot Jacob Blake? Lots of speculation. WHAT IS HIS NAME? That this man did THAT and we still aren’t 100% sure of his name is outrageous.

“Lots of speculation. WHAT IS HIS NAME? That this man did THAT and we still aren’t 100% sure of his name is outrageous. That man is somewhere deleting all of his racist social media posts, cleaning up his whole life.”

King’s Twitter feed is also replete with posts showing various random officers who King thinks may have been involved in the shooting.

In another tweet King identified officer Luke Courtier, saying “Police could end this right now.”

“They are deliberately protecting the man who shot Jacob. What’s his name?” he asked.

On Wednesday, King also spread conspiracy theories claiming Kenosha police collaborated with “white supremacists” ahead of Tuesday night’s deadly shootings, driving protesters toward armed counter-protesters to be gunned down.

Look at this white supremacist. He says that police told him that they would push protestors in Kenosha toward them, and then leave. And they did just that. Then they murdered 2 men. pic.twitter.com/O4NZ0Ch4so — Shaun King (@shaunking) August 26, 2020

It’s unclear what King will do once he obtains the information he’s seeking.

“President Trump is the first President in a generation to seek to end war rather than start one. He intends to end the war in Afghanistan. He is bringing our men and women home.”

Paul then invited the audience to compare Trump’s anti-war record with Joe Biden’s hawkish foreign policy record as vice president, who voted for the Iraq War and the numerous other wars launched in Syria, Libya, and elsewhere.

“Compare President Trump with the disastrous record of Hillary Clinton or Joe Biden, who consistently called for more war,” Paul said. “Joe Biden voted for the Iraq War, which President Trump has long called the worst geopolitical mistake of our generation.”

“I fear Biden will choose war again,” Paul continued. “He supported war in Serbia, Syria, and Libya. Joe Biden will continue to spill our blood and treasure. President Trump will bring our heroes home.”

331,https://www.infowars.com/shots-fired-in-kenosha-wisconsin/,2020-08-26T17:55:49,infowars,"As the third night of rioting kicked off, the Kenosha Police Department declared an enforced State Of Emergency curfew for 8pm on August 25th.

However, at approximately 11:45 pm shots were fired resulting in two fatalities and a third individual was seriously injured.

The shooting erupted after BLM rioters aggressively confronted an unconfirmed militia organization that was defending a business.

The shooter who had been chased by a mob is being reported as a 17-year-old named Kyle Rittenhouse from Illinois who apparently surrendered to police after the shooting.

Now that two rioters have been killed and another may have his arm amputated, the boiling point has been reached.

Regardless, the governor of Wisconsin has been slow to allow President Trump’s assistance and the National Guard to secure the streets of Kenosha, Wisconsin, instead calling for “limited mobilization.”

MILWAUKEE J.S. SAYS ARREST MADE RELATED TO THE KENOSHA SHOOTING

Meanwhile, the Daily Dot has reportedly pulled court papers showing that 17-year-old Kyle Rittenhouse was arrested and charged with first degree murder and labeled a “fugitive from justice.”

The complaint states that Rittenhouse “fled the state of Wisconsin with intent to avoid prosecution for that offense” (we understand that sloppy handwriting is difficult to read).

People v Kyle Rittenhouse by The Daily Dot

Update (1240ET): The Internet is scrambling to identify the young man who allegedly shot and killed two people during the mayhem in Kenosha last night, which was the third night of violence in the city where Jacob Blake was shot by a cop on Sunday.

The alleged shooter has been identified by the left-wing mob (who are trying to tarry him as a “mass shooter”) as Kyle Rittenhouse, a local teenager who reportedly has ties to local law enforcement. After the shooting, the shooter (allegedly Rittenhouse) put his hands in the air and walked over to police nearby, but what happened next isn’t exactly clear.

As of noon on Wednesday, nobody has been apprehended in the shootings, though the sheriff of Kenosha has said an arrest in the violence should be coming “soon.” Leftists are also trying to spread a “conspiracy theory” about the shooter accepting water from riot police, evidence that he was working with the local cops.

According to RT, some have tried to tie Rittenhouse to the “Boogaloo Movement” a group of alleged “white supremacists” trying to start a new American civil war. So far, there appears to be no evidence that he was affiliated with the movement, and in an interview which we shared below, but which has since gone viral, a man who appears to be the teenaged Rittenhouse can be heard saying he was there to protect property, not because of any militia affiliation.

* * *

Update (1030ET): A second cell phone video of the officer-involved shooting of 29-year-old Jacob Blake on Sunday has emerged, showing the incident in a slightly new light.

The footage showed Blake fighting with officers before he took off and ran to the driver’s door of his vehicle with police on his heels (video showed). The video suggests he may indeed have had a knife, and had ignored orders to drop it, before being shot.

It also suggested that Blake’s girlfriend lied to police when she claimed he hadn’t been hostile.

Another witness filmed part of the encounter between Kenosha police and Blake on his cell phone from across the street, but that video didn’t show any scuffle with police.

* * *

Update (0950ET): Kenosha County Sheriff David Beth held another press conference Wednesday morning to discuss the deadly shootings, and other crimes committed across the city during a third night of violence.

The Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel reported that police expect to make an arrest in a case stemming from the shootings “soon”, and that the FBI has been “assisting” local investigators, implying that the shooter will likely be taken into custody.

No one has been apprehended, but Beth said he believed at least one person would be taken into custody soon based on video footage police have reviewed. “I feel very confident we’ll have him in a very short time,” Beth said.

Beth attributed the progress to the “resources” provided by the FBI.

The investigation of the latest shooting is being conducted by the Kenosha Police Department with the assistance of the FBI, Beth said. “We’ve got a lot of resources that are helping us pull this stuff together,” Beth said of the shooting investigation.

Roughly 250 law enforcement officers and 250 National Guard members were on hand Tuesday night to try and quell the unrest, and property damage was much less intense during the third night of unrest – however, clashes between militia groups and hard-core progressive groups that resembled street violence appeared to play out in the streets of Kenosha.

The shooting took place right in the heart of the city, according to MJS.

The incident happened on Sheridan Road in the heart of Kenosha near the Froedert South hospital building. Many people were still on the streets in protest just before the shooting, walking up and down Sheridan Road, where protesters had been driven after being expelled from Civic Center Park.

Here are some more interesting tidbits from the report.

A Journal Sentinel reporter earlier in the evening observed a group of armed men with long guns standing guard at a dry cleaning business on Sheridan Road near 59th Street, some on the roof. Police told them to get off the roof and a person shouted back: “Officer, this is our business.” Police did not ultimately order them off the roof. Police did not ultimately make them get off the roof. […] It is unclear if the men seen by the reporter were members of the Kenosha Guard, or whether Beth, in his comments, was referring to that group, or similar groups of people. Before the shooting, someone from Kenosha suggested to Beth that he deputize ordinary citizens to help contain the unrest. Beth said he refused. “I said, ‘There’s no way I’m doing that,'” Beth said.

Meanwhile, GOP Senator Ron Johnson, who represents Wisconsin in the Senate alongside Democrat Tammy Baldwin (who hasn’t said much of anything), urged Democratic Gov Tony Evers to accept President Trump’s offer for federal reinforcements.

* * *

Already, the riots in Kenosha inspired by the police shooting of unarmed Jacob Blake, who was shot in the back while trying to enter a car with his children in the back seat (Blake was hit by 4 of the 7 shots, some reports said he had been armed at one point), have led to the deaths of at least 2 people.

Despite the governor’s decision to declare a state of emergency after a second night of violence, police and the national guard were once again largely absent in a stream of horrifying video from last night’s riots, which at times devolved into open street warfare between groups of rioters and armed people allegedly there to protect property.

Several videos of at least one of the fatal shootings flooded Twitter last night.

Police confirmed to the press that they responded to two fatal shootings and at least one non-fatal shooting during the third night of protests inspired by the shooting of Blake.

Evers said he authorized 250 Wisconsin National Guard troops to protect critical infrastructure and assist Kenosha authorities, but once again, these reinforcements stayed clear of local businesses and offered almost no assistance in the protection of private property.

Kenosha officials said another 100 law enforcement officers from surrounding areas were brought in to assist local police. An 8pm curfew was in effect for the area.

“We will continue to work with local, state and federal law enforcement in holding those criminals who are destroying our city responsible,” Kenosha Mayor John Antamarian said in a statement.

And former NYC Mayor Rudy Giuliani had a response.

Kenosha police said early Wednesday that they had responded to a report of multiple gunshots just before midnight. Authorities said two people were killed in the shooting, and a third gunshot victim was transported to the hospital with serious, a story that is more or less consistent with the videos we shared above.

An investigation into the shooting is reportedly ongoing. Kenosha County Sheriff David Beth told the NYT that police are investigating whether the shooting resulted from a conflict between demonstrators and a group of armed men there to protect local businesses. CNN reported that armed riot police fired tear gas and pepper spray into the crowd, while Blake’s family pleaded for calm on Tuesday.

One Twitter user shared what she alleged was an interview with the shooter (who can be seen above being chased by another man with a gun) from before the attack. In the interview he can be heard saying he is armed with live ammunition.

The protests have triggered gatherings of armed citizens, some of whom said they were protecting property against looting. Videos shared widely on social media have shown storefront after storefront ablaze, along with dozens of cars – rampant, indefensible, mayhem. And if the government won’t stop it – for whatever reason – sometimes people take responsibility into their own hands, which is one of the reasons the second amendment was enshrined in the constitution via the Bill of Rights.

Athens’ maritime boundaries will be extended from six to 12 nautical miles in the Ionian Sea, which stretches from the western coast of Greece to the eastern coast of Italy. That’s according to a surprise statement by Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis, who said the corresponding bill will be submitted to Parliament.

The move comes in line with an “inalienable sovereign right” and is based on the Convention on the Law of the Sea, Mitsotakis clarified.

Greece has recently inked two agreements on defining maritime borders – one with Italy and one with Egypt. The deals, which the prime minister said were of “major historical and political significance,” will be put to a parliamentary vote on Thursday.

The developments are sure to anger Turkey, whose Grand National Assembly stated in 1995 that if Greece unilaterally extended its territorial waters it would be a “casus belli” (provocation for war) for Ankara. Turkey referred to the resolution a few years ago, meaning that it wasn’t shelved.

Both countries, which have overlapping territorial claims in the Eastern Mediterranean, have recently engaged in a fiery war of words after oil and gas deposits were discovered in the contested area. The two nations have also staged rival military exercises to send messages to one another.

While cities like Portland have seen riots on a nightly basis for a virtually unbroken time period, the mayhem has now spread to Kenosha, Wisconsin, where two people were fatally shot last night.

The bedlam is now reflected in the polls, with Americans becoming increasingly concerned about law and order.

“A sizable 59 percent of voters in the survey indicate that violent crime, which President Trump has framed as happening in Democrat-controlled cities, is a ‘very important’ factor in casting their ballots,” writes Rusty Weiss.

He cites a Pew poll which found that coronavirus has dropped to the fourth most important issue with 63 percent concerned.

""A new Pew survey found that violent crime is now the fifth-most important issue for votes, with 59% listing it as 'very important' to their vote. For context, it’s nearly as important to Americans as the coronavirus, which ranks fourth with 63%""https://t.co/25M33A3GVy — Josh Kraushaar (@HotlineJosh) August 24, 2020

When broken down along party lines, 74 percent of Trump supporters view violent crime as an important issue compared to 46 percent of likely Biden voters.

As we highlighted earlier, CNN host Don Lemon appears to be worried that the relentless riots and unrest that have plagued American cities for the last three months are aiding Trump.

“I think Democrats are ignoring this problem or hoping that it will go away…Joe Biden may be afraid to do it…He’s got to address it. He’s got to come out and talk about it,” said Lemon.

A CNN poll taken earlier this month also found that Biden’s lead over Trump had dropped 10 points since early June.

Meanwhile, the public’s diminishing concern about coronavirus also appears to be helping President Trump’s approval rating in the polls.

A new poll released today that was taken immediately after the DNC found that “Trump had a 48% approval rating and a 52% disapproval rating among likely voters in Arizona, Florida, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin.”

This compares with a 46%/54% approve/disapprove split two weeks ago, when fears about COVID-19 were slightly higher.

The only good news out of last week’s Democratic convention was that it was finally over.

The only glimmer of hope out of the whole gloomfest was that we would not have to hear any more from these people about what a racist, unfair, impoverished, helpless dungheap America is today. And always has been.

Maybe for just one week we might have a reprieve from all the unhinged hateful rhetoric about how President Trump — with malice in his heart — personally killed 170,000 Americans this year.

And that was after he somehow stole the 2016 election, got into bed with the Russians, stole Ukraine, jailed all of Mexico and is now firebombing the U.S. Postal Service so that he — now, stay with me here — can remain in power forever.

What the Post Office has to do with any of this is anybody’s guess. Crazy times, indeed.

But the loony screed goes on!

Even twice-failed presidential candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton won’t shut up, offering some pretty chilling advice to Democratic nominee Joe Biden, also a twice-failed (for now) presidential candidate.

“Joe Biden should not concede under any circumstances,” she said on a video program aptly named “The Circus.”

Why anyone would listen to political advice from Mrs. Clinton is unclear. But I suppose in the land of (at least) twice-failed presidential candidates, the one who at least made it to Super Tuesday twice is king.

Or, in this case, “queen.” And an expert on refusing to concede. It’s been nearly four years since she lost the 2016 election and she still refuses to concede!

Either way, it’s pretty rancid advice during pretty rancid times. No wonder she never got elected president and the closest she ever got to the White House was on the coattails of her husband, that great paragon of virtue (especially when it came to the interns).

All this noise is (purposefully) interrupting this week’s Republican convention that featured a truly gracious, elegant and self-made first lady Tuesday night. Melania Trump’s speech was as clear-headed and sober as she was stunning.

But that did not prevent all the haters in the Democrat Party from accusing a world-class fashion model of dressing up as some kind of Russian dictator.

These people are nuts.

Also unveiled was the first lady’s newly redesigned Rose Garden outside the Oval Office. Democrats and the bitter set in Washington were appalled that Mrs. Trump would dare update plantings left by Jackie Kennedy.

The zig-zag designs of the new boxwoods, these lunatics claimed, somehow spelled out “KKK.” You have to be one seriously sick racist to find such things in a garden design.

But, oh, Camelot. Shamalot.

This is as good a time as any to remind the world that it was Jackie’s disgusting husband, John F. Kennedy, who instructed his young White House intern to perform oral sex on one of his top administration officials in the White House swimming pool — while JFK himself looked on.

These people were the original sickos. Even the Clintons were no match for the Kennedys in this department. Bubba was at least house-broken enough to shut the door when he was molesting the intern and defiling her with his cigar.

Mr. Trump, meanwhile, earned vicious condemnation from Democrats for performing a naturalization ceremony during the Republican convention.

How dare he use immigrants as props! After all, Democrats are the only ones allowed to use immigrants as props.

Though, to be fair, only those immigrants who are illegal.

“I hate it that he was laying in that bed with the handcuff onto the bed,” Blake’s father said Thursday, according to the Chicago Sun-Tines. “He can’t go anywhere. Why do you have him cuffed to the bed?”

Blake is reportedly paralyzed from the waist down, but it is not yet known if the injury is permanent.

The revelation drew ire across social media, prompting the Kenosha County Sheriff’s office to explain that Blake had felony warrants for his arrest from crimes committed prior to the police-involved altercation. He was wanted on charges of sexual assault, criminal trespassing, and disorderly conduct, as a court records show.

“Jacob Blake has felony warrants for his arrest from crimes he committed prior to the shooting incident,” Kenosha County Sheriff’s Department spokesman Sgt. David Wright said, according to CBS Chicago.

“Anyone with this classification level that we are guarding in the hospital would be treated in this manner,” Wright added:

The Wisconsin Department of Justice (DOJ) Division of Criminal Investigation (DCI) is currently investigating the officer-involved incident. The DOJ revealed in an update on Friday that two officers, Kenosha police officers Rusten Sheskey and Vincent Arenas, attempted to deploy their tasers to subdue Blake during the arrest. Neither were successful, at which point Blake “walked around his vehicle, opened the driver’s side door, and leaned forward.”

Sheskey, who has served with the Kenosha Police Department for seven years, was the only officer to fire his weapon.

Kenosha Police Officer Brittany Meronek was also present at the time of the incident.

An eyewitness of the altercation said that police told Blake to “drop the knife,” which Blake later admitted to having in his possession.

“How the f**k do you handcuff Jacob Blake that you paralyzed to a hospital bed after you shot him in the back seven times?” Tlaib asked.

“I oppose a system where the perpetrators of attempted murder get to handcuff their victim. No system should have this much power,” she continued, and said, “You can’t reform this”:

Blake’s father, while detailing his recent visit with his son, revealed that Blake was handcuffed to the hospital bed, despite being partially paralyzed.

“I hate it that he was laying in that bed with the handcuff onto the bed,” he said. “He can’t go anywhere. Why do you have him cuffed to the bed?”

Kenosha County Sheriff’s Department spokesman Sgt. David Wright responded to the mounting criticisms, explaining that Blake was under an active arrest warrant at the time of the altercation.

“Jacob Blake has felony warrants for his arrest from crimes he committed prior to the shooting incident,” Kenosha County Sheriff’s Department spokesman Sgt. David Wright said, according to CBS Chicago.

“Anyone with this classification level that we are guarding in the hospital would be treated in this manner,” he explained.

Court records show the warrant issued July 7 was for offenses including sexual abuse, disorderly conduct, and criminal trespassing.

According to the Wisconsin Department of Justice (DOJ), three police officers were present during the August 23 incident, prompted by a call from a woman who “reported that her boyfriend was present and was not supposed to be on the premises.” Two police officers deployed their tasers during Blake’s arrest, but the attempts ultimately failed.

The latest update from the Wisconsin DOJ reads in part:

Mr. Blake walked around his vehicle, opened the driver’s side door, and leaned forward. While holding onto Mr. Blake’s shirt, Officer Rusten Sheskey fired his service weapon 7 times. Officer Sheskey fired the weapon into Mr. Blake’s back. No other officer fired their weapon. Kenosha Police Department does not have body cameras, therefore the officers were not wearing body cameras. The shooting officer, Kenosha Police Officer Rusten Sheskey, has been a law enforcement officer with Kenosha Police Department for seven years. Kenosha Police Officer Vincent Arenas has served with Kenosha Police Department since February 2019, with prior service with the United States Capitol Police Department. Also present was Kenosha Police Officer Brittany Meronek who joined Kenosha Police Department in January of this year.

Authorities later recovered a knife from Blake’s vehicle — a weapon he admitted to possessing.

The incident has sparked violent riots across Kenosha night after night, prompting Gov. Tony Evers (D) to request additional assistance from other states.

Breitbart News has explained — and debunked — the hoax frequently:

President Trump repeatedly condemned the neo-Nazis in Charlottesville in August 2017 — “totally.” Moreover, the neo-Nazis were not the only violent group in Charlottesville. The “clash” was not with those “standing against” hate peacefully, but with violent, black-clad Antifa extremists. As to “very fine people,” Trump had been referring to peaceful protests both for and against the removal of a statue of Confederate General Robert E. Lee. He completely condemned the extremists — as the timeline and transcript confirm: Aug. 12, 2017: Trump condemned “violence “on many sides” in Charlottesville, after neo-Nazi and Antifa clashes

Aug. 14, 2017: Trump condemned “neo-Nazis, white supremacists, and other hate groups” in White House statement

Aug. 15, 2017: Trump condemned neo-Nazis “totally,” praised non-violent protesters “on both sides” of statue debate Biden launched his campaign with the Charlottesville hoax, and persisted in doing so, even after Breitbart News confronted him last August with the fact that he was misquoting the president.

The BBC also fact-checked Biden’s claim as false when he repeated them in his acceptance speech at the Democratic National Convention (DNC) last week.

Rasmussen surveyed 1,000 likely voters about the issue and reported Friday:

Most voters don’t remember President Trump’s remarks about the 2017 racial melee in Charlottesville, Va. the way Joe Biden does. But the false narrative embraced by the president’s opponents has become fact for a sizable number.

A new Rasmussen Reports national telephone and online survey finds that 52% of Likely U.S. Voters correctly believe that the president was critical of radical protesters on both sides of the incident but added that there were also “very fine people” on both sides who were present that day. Thirty-nine percent (39%) say instead that Trump just praised white supremacists in the incident as “very fine people.”

The margin of error in the poll was 3% with 95% confidence.

Her comments came the morning after she declared: “The reality is that the life of a black person in America has never been treated as fully human.”

NBC’s Craig Melvin appeared to offer Harris a way to dispel concerns that she is too far left (from the NBC transcript):

Melvin: Perhaps you’ve heard one of the chief criticisms of the Biden/Harris Ticket by some is you’re radical. You’re a radical liberal. And some who are saying they’re not liberal enough. Harris: The most important point I think can be made about the diversity of who we are is an embrace of who we are. That’s who we are as democrats. We embrace who we are. We’re not requiring people to march and fall in line. If you want to call that radical, perhaps it is in the eyes of Donald Trump. But I would say a quest for unity and a fight for an America that sees everyone and a vision of the future of America in which everyone can see themselves is reflective of who we are and who we are aspire to be as a nation and our strength as a nation. Melvin: So it sound like you’re a radical centrist. Harris: I am saying I’m radically in love with my country.

Pence spoke in Minnesota, a state Trump and Pence narrowly lost during the 2016 presidential election by 1.5 percentage points. Now, the Trump-Pence team has targeted the state and hopes to expand their foothold in Congress.

For instance, former Rep. Jason Lewis (R-MN) hopes to unseat Sen. Tina Smith (D-MN) during the 2020 elections.

The former congressman added that the Republican National Convention (RNC) was “four days of optimism.”

Lewis said that Trump’s tax cuts and regulation cuts helped stir manufacturing and job growth in Minnesota.

He further joked that the Democrat National Convention “looked like an H.R. meeting on Zoom.”

Rep. Pete Stauber (R-MN) said Trump “brought mining and manufacturing back to the shores of the United States.”

Pence said that the RNC was “incredibly stirring and incredibly inspiring.”

“Our convention was a celebration of American greatness,” he said.

Virginia, Minnesota, Mayor Larry Cuffe, and Ely, Minnesota, Mayor Chris Swanson spoke as well and noted that they, along with many other Iron Range mayors, endorsed Trump for his reelection. They charged that the Democratic Party, as well as the Democrat-Farmer-Labor Party, moved too far to the left and neglected the plight of the American worker.

They wrote:

We have watched as our constituents’ jobs left not only the Iron Range, but our country. By putting tariffs on our products and supporting bad trade deals, politicians like Joe Biden did nothing to help the working class. We lost thousands of jobs, and generations of young people have left the Iron Range in order to provide for their families with good-paying jobs elsewhere. Today, we don’t recognize the Democratic Party. It has been moved so far to the left it can no longer claim to be advocates of the working class. The hard-working Minnesotans that built their lives and supported their families here on the Range have been abandoned by radical Democrats. We didn’t choose to leave the Democratic Party, the party left us.

Pence charged that, through their pro-worker policies, they could rebuild the Minnesota and the American economy, unlike former Vice President Joe Biden, who wants to tank the economy with socialist policies.

He said that this election is a “choice between we allow Joe Biden and the Democrat party to advance a socialist agenda … or we stand and fight for the American Dream.”

Pence said that a Biden administration would return “back to economic surrender with China.” He emphasized that Trump’s tariffs leveled the “playing field” for American workers.

“The road to victory begins in Duluth, Minnesota, and .. we’re going to win the state,” the vice president said.

Pence said when mining was shut down in the Iron Range, Biden told miners to “learn to code,” adding “Trump always stands up for the Iron Range.”

In July, U.S. Tech Workers, former Attorney General Jeff Sessions, and TVA union workers blew the whistle on the federally-owned corporation’s contracts with firms Capgemini, Accenture, and CGI to force about 200 American workers out of their jobs and make them train their foreign H-1B visa replacements.

In the middle of the American workers’ training their H-1B replacements, Trump stepped in to stop the outsourcing scheme, required TVA to rehire all the Americans they had outsourced, fired TVA chairman Skip Thompson, and pressured the corporation to review TVA CEO Jeff Lyash’s $8 million salary.

The self-described “socialist” magazine Jacobin admitted in a piece titled “How Trump Got His Right-Wing New Deal Victory” that the president filled the void for saving the jobs of American workers where Democrats failed to even acknowledge the issue.

Jacobin‘s Fred Stafford wrote:

Only two Democrats — Sen. Doug Jones of Alabama and Rep. Steve Cohen of Tennessee — spoke to the union about fighting the outsourcing, the same number as Republicans who did so. Cohen requested that House Democratic leadership include, in a coronavirus relief bill, “language that prohibits federal government agencies, including the TVA, from privatizing federal jobs during the COVID-19 pandemic,” but no such language ever materialized. [Emphasis added]

“What follows is a dark lesson about what happens when the Left ignores its historic commitment to workers,” Stafford wrote, calling Trump’s action against TVA “a material victory for a small but not insignificant number of American workers.”

Stafford continued:

And just like that, Trump had saved two hundred union workers at one of the last bastions of the New Deal’s legacy, and during an unprecedented global crisis to boot. An easier political victory for such a loathed figure would be hard to find. And worse, for the first time in months, the polls for November’s presidential election are suddenly tightening. [Emphasis added]

Surveys and poll taken this year show the public is overwhelmingly on Trump’s side of the labor issue as majorities continue to oppose corporation’s outsourcing of American jobs to imported foreign workers.

While tens of millions of Americans remain jobless and underemployed, nearly 60 percent of American adults told Ipsos pollsters in July that they want to halt foreign visa worker programs — such as the H-1B visa — so that Americans are prioritized for jobs. In June, a majority of Americans, including black Americans, said there is no labor shortage.

Aside from ordering all federal agencies to conduct internal audits to clarify that they are not displacing American workers with imported foreign visa workers, Trump has halted the H-1B, H-2B, H-4, L-1, and J-1 visa programs to give job priority to unemployed Americans. The State Department has sought to poke loopholes in the order.

At the Republican National Convention (RNC) this week, Trump said one of his main priorities is “quickly returning to full employment” and invited many of the TVA workers to the speech.

Every year, the U.S. admits about 1.2 million legal immigrants on green cards to permanently resettle in the country. In addition, another 1.4 million foreign workers are admitted every year to take American jobs. Often, Americans are fired and replaced by visa workers. Many are forced to train their foreign replacements.

In June 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court reaffirmed the president’s control over legal immigration. In Trump v. Hawaii, the court stated that presidents have extraordinarily broad discretion to admit or exclude foreign nationals from the U.S. when they believe doing so is in the national interest.

The move is widely viewed as targeting China’s influence on the country.

Prime Minister Scott Morrison proposed a law on Thursday that would allow Australia’s foreign minister to “examine all existing and future deals with foreign governments and to abolish or cancel them. All deals will be included in a public register,” according to the Straits Times. “The law excludes companies but covers local councils which enter sister-city arrangements with foreign entities” along with “states, territories, and universities.”

Australia currently has no legislative requirement that states and territories consult with federal officials prior to arranging deals with foreign governments. Morrison said in a statement on Thursday that the Foreign Relations bill would help safeguard Australia’s national interest.

“Australians rightly expect the federal government they elect to set foreign policy,” Morrison said. “These changes and new laws will ensure that every arrangement done by any Australian government at any level now lines up with how we are working to protect and promote Australia’s national interest.”

Morrison’s conservative government will introduce the bill to Parliament next week. Australia’s leftist opposition Labor Party has indicated support for the law, meaning it will likely pass.

Although officials have not specifically mentioned China in proposing the new law, observers say the main motivation behind the bill is the Australian government’s concern that states and universities have been entering into agreements with Chinese entities at great risk to national security. In 2019, the Australian state of Victoria signed a deal with Beijing to join its infrastructure-building Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), which the Chinese Communist Party uses to expand its sphere of influence. The state’s decision reportedly alarmed the federal government, which may seek to use the new law, should it pass later this year, to override the plan.

In an interview with Australia’s ABC Radio on Thursday, Australian Deputy Prime Minister Michael McCormack alluded to future action against Victoria’s BRI deal with China.

“There’s been discussions between the prime minister and Victoria” regarding the law’s possible impact on the BRI deal, McCormack said. “We want to make sure that if there are arrangements being put in place that they are done in the national interest,” he added.",Australian PM Seeks Federal Powers to Veto States' Deals with China,fake

Biden made the comments – as documented in the Obama White House digital archives and reported by Fox News and the Washington Examiner on Twitter – while speaking at Sichuan University in 2012.

“But as I was talking to some of your leaders, you share a similar concern here in China,” Biden said. “You have no safety net. Your policy has been one which I fully understand – I’m not second-guessing – of one child per family. The result being that you’re in a position where one wage earner will be taking care of four retired people. Not sustainable.”

“So hopefully we can act in a way on a problem that’s much less severe than yours, and maybe we can learn together from how we can do that,” Biden said.

In 1979, China made it illegal for couples to bear more than one child in their lifetimes, attempting to curb population growth while striving for industrialization. Women who became pregnant a second time were forced to abort. If caught pregnant late in their term, the government would still kill their child. An estimated 400 million births were “prevented” between 1979 and 2015 when dictator Xi Jinping expanded the policy to allow two children in the wake of a precipitous decline in the national birth rate. “Prevented” includes abortions and infanticides, particularly of baby girls, as boys were more traditionally desirable for couples and those who had girls chose to kill them and try again for a boy. Many abandoned infants in open-air markets, where they would die and rot in public.

A feature in the Atlantic last year discussed the One Child Nation documentary, which includes interviews with an 84-year-old Chinese mid-wife, Huaru Yuan, who said she has performed “50,000 to 60,000 sterilizations and abortions.”

The Atlantic reported some of the gruesome details from the film:

As One Child Nation continues, the trail of horrors it depicts becomes long and winding. When China opened its doors to international adoption in 1992, many state-run orphanages became sites for human trafficking. Through her interviews, Wang learns about how newborns from families who violated the policy were kidnapped by family-planning officials and sold to orphanages, a detail that was repressed by the government (in the film, Wang speaks with a journalist who was eventually forced to flee to Hong Kong because of his reporting). To this day, many adoptees—and their families—find learning the truth about their origins nearly impossible. A significant number of the babies sold were abandoned by their families or given to “matchmakers” for adoption. Many of the infants were girls given up by parents who hoped instead for a male child to carry on the family name. In one scene, Wang’s uncle recalls the loss of his newborn daughter, who was left on a meat counter in a market and died two days later when no one took her. Another of Wang’s relatives talks about how she gave away her own daughter to a human trafficker, fearing the child would die if abandoned.

China changed its one-child policy to a two-child policy in 2015. Forced abortions and infanticide continue, as detailed in the 2017 annual report of the Congressional-Executive Commission on China (CECC), led by Sen. Marco Rubio and Rep. Chris Smith.

The Charlotte Lozier Institute reported on the revelations:

The report confirms that population planning regulations continue to exist at the provincial level that “instruct officials to carry out abortions, often referred to as ‘remedial measures’ (bujiu cuoshi), for ‘out-of-plan’ pregnancies.” The report cites family planning regulations from Jiangxi and Hubei provinces and the Shenzhen municipality. Also noted are official reports from local government authorities which state that women are compelled to undergo the “four procedures” which are IUD insertion, sterilization, first trimester abortion, and mid- to late-term abortion. This is cited for the following: Gu County, Guichi District, Yunyang District, Wolong District, and Dongshahe Township. Other reports have found this same abuse. The State Department’s Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2016 also found that coerced abortions continue to take place under China’s revised Population and Family Planning Law. The law states that a citizen’s “lawful rights” should not be violated in enforcing the family planning policy, yet the State Department’s report indicates that these rights are not clearly specified in the law. Also, there are seven activities listed in the law which are prohibited when officials implement the birth limit, and forced abortion is not one of them. The report notes there are regulations in Hunan, Hubei, and Liaoning provinces which require women to terminate pregnancies not in compliance with the law and confirms that these regulations have been enforced.

Reggie Littlejohn, founder and president of Women’s Rights Without Frontiers, spoke about China’s two-child policy in an interview in 2017:

Yes, China is not the only place where gendercide happens. But there are things that are unique to China. The main one is the coercive population control. For decades, there’s been the One-Child Policy. Now China has modified its policy from a One-Child Policy to a Two-Child Policy, but the way the Chinese government announced that was very misleading. They stated that they had “abandoned” the One-Child Policy. The mainstream media really picked up on that word, and now people think that all coercive population control in China is over, and that’s not true. They just switched it from a One-Child Policy to a Two-Child Policy. So that now every couple in China is allowed to have two children. What does that mean? That means that the entire infrastructure of surveillance and coercion are still there. Women are still having quarterly pregnancy checks to make sure that they’re not illegally pregnant. They can still require a waiting period between the first child and the second child. And if you get pregnant during the waiting period, you can still be subject to forced abortion. Children can still be forcibly aborted. We had some cases that came out of China last year, 2016, where women were subject to forced abortion of third children. So coercion is continuing under the Two-Child Policy.

At the recent Democratic National Convention, the pro-abortion stance of the party — even up to the time of birth — was not a talking point, although abortion is still a part of the party platform.

“The only place it is seeking normalization is in the left and the hard left,” said Cuccinelli of politically-driven criminal violence and vandalism. “[I have seen] Antifa polling, where half the people who self-identify as liberal think it’s okay to use violence to oppose speech that you find offensive. Well, that is about as un-American and tyrannical as you could possibly imagine. So that’s what we’re dealing with on the left, and it provokes a response.”

Cuccinelli continued, “If law enforcement is incapable of dealing with it, the sort of American culture of do-it-yourselfism is going to assert itself, along with gun ownership, and everything else as we saw in Kenosha, and that’s what will grow, and that isn’t good for anybody. This is why the president has been really rhetorically beating on these governors to use the tools that they absolutely have at their disposal to address the problem.”

LISTEN:

He further contrasted the conduct of Govs. Kate Brown (D-OR) and Tony Evers (D-WI) in relation to dealings with President Donald Trump in halting violence in Portland and Kenosha, respectively.

Cuccinelli remarked, “Governor Evers very quickly started moving his national guard in, [which is] something that Governor Brown has continued to refuse to do in Oregon. I wish Governor Evers had moved more in faster, because it’s rather obvious, I think, that the numbers he was bringing weren’t quite up to the task. But he talked to the president, [and] the president was very emphatic in pushing him harder and telling him [that] we’ll provide federal support [and] bring guard from other states, but it has to be with the agreement of the home governor.”

He then linked Evers’ delayed acceptance of federal security help to Tuesday’s shooting in Kenosha. “On day one of the president’s conversation with Governor Evers, that didn’t go anywhere, and then you had the shootings that night, proving — unfortunately — the president right in some of the worst ways possible.”

Violence begets more violence, held Cuccinelli, warning of a momentum to violent unrest if riots are not stopped.

Cuccinelli stated, “The reality is, if this sort of violence is allowed to fester, it escalates. It’s an invitation to escalation.” He described Kenosha as an “Everytown, USA kind of a place.”

“If this can blow up [in Kenosha], it can blow up anywhere, and unfortunately some of the viciousness we’re seeing across so much of the left tells us that these people with these tyrannical, violent, vicious tendencies — and communist ideology, frankly — are all over the country,” Cuccinelli concluded.

Dozens of looters broke into Bellevue Square mall and other downtown businesses while demonstrators protested the death of George Floyd nearby on May 31. Bellevue Police Chief Steve Mylett previously called the looting “a well-organized plan” and did not believe the looters were there to protest Floyd’s death. Most of the suspects face charges of burglary 2, possession of stolen property or malicious mischief, Bellevue police said Thursday. Bellevue police say detectives looked through 10,000 pieces of video evidence from security cameras or the public to find the suspects.

“Our detectives are combing through more than ten-thousand pieces of video evidence from store security cameras or the public,” Bellevue Police Captain Travess Forbush said in a statement. “It’s a tedious and time-consuming process, but an important one. We will continue to investigate, identify, and hold those responsible for the destruction in downtown Bellevue.”

“We want to give prosecutors everything they need to try a successful case,” Forbush added. “We are sending a clear message; we will not tolerate looting, and we will come after anyone responsible.”

Bellevue police announced in June that 23 people were arrested and 100 more were identified for questioning by investigators.

Rep. Michael Waltz (R-FL) announced Friday that he, along with Reps. Stephanie Murphy (D-FL) and Dan Crenshaw (R-TX), received a letter from Pentagon Secretary Mark Esper agreeing that Cashe deserves to have his Silver Star upgraded to the Medal of Honor, the nation’s highest combat award for valor for his heroism in October 2005.

Cashe was deployed to Iraq in 2005 when his fighting vehicle hit an improvised explosive device and caught fire. Cashe escaped the vehicle but returned repeated times to pull soldiers out of the flames, while he himself caught on fire and was exposed to enemy gunfire. Cashe later died of his wounds.

Veterans on the right and the left have long pushed for his Silver Star to be upgraded to the Medal of Honor, but it will not be until the Trump administration where it will likely now happen.

Esper said in the letter that he reviewed a proposal by Waltz, Murphy, and Crenshaw to upgrade Cashe’s Silver Star and agreed that his actions merit award of the Medal of Honor.

Esper said that since the award must be awarded within five years after the date of the act justifying the award, Congress will need to first waive the limit. After that, he will provide his endorsement to Trump, and then the “final award authority” rests solely with the president.

Breitbart News reached out to the White House for comment but has not received a response. However, it is unlikely that Trump will not decide to award Cashe the Medal of Honor.

Waltz and Crenshaw already offered a successful floor amendment to the fiscal year 2020 National Defense Authorization Act to waive the statute of limitations for Cashe’s Silver Star to be upgraded to the Medal of Honor.

“Alwyn Cashe’s extraordinary courage on behalf of his fellow soldiers, in the face of danger and death, embodies everything the Medal of Honor represents,” said Waltz.

“Cashe is a Florida and American hero. He without a doubt deserves our nation’s highest honor — and I’m very glad Secretary Esper and our Department of Defense agree and recognize his heroic actions. Now Congress needs to act to waive the five-year statute of limitations and allow the Department of Defense’s recommendation to move forward and proceed to the President to give final approval,” he added.

Murphy said in a statement, “Alwyn was a hero in the purest and most profound sense. He gave his own life to save the lives of his fellow soldiers.”

“I am overjoyed that the Secretary of Defense has determined that SFC Cashe’s actions merit the Medal of Honor, a conclusion I strongly share. I will work with my colleagues to swiftly grant the President the authority he needs to provide this valiant soldier with the recognition he earned,” she said.

Crenshaw added, “Heroes are all around us but certain heroes stand out. One of those heroes is Sergeant First Class Alwyn Cashe. Alwyn Cashe’s actions saved his men’s lives. He risked his own life as he pulled them out of a flaming Bradley Fighting Vehicle and went back – again and again.”

“From Secretary Esper’s statement, we are poised to fully recognize the full extent of his heroism by finally awarding him the Medal of Honor, our nation’s highest military award for bravery on the battlefield,” he said. “He is a hero and his story is one all Americans should know so we can look upon his example and aspire to the example he displayed.”

“Why won’t you put one on? It’s easy. It’s easy. Here. I have a box for you. I’ll let you take one yourself,” he continued, waving the masks in his face.

“Who are you protecting and serving? That little boy you go home to is going to get sick because of this,” the main protester in the video continued. “If you have a little girl, she’s going to get sick.”

“I know you don’t want mommy and daddy getting sick so take a fucking mask,” he said, taunting the officer and waving the masks in his face yet again.

He faces life in prison if convicted.

In both alleged murders, the complaint describes Rittenhouse being attacked first, suggesting he may claim self-defense.

He is also charged with attempted murder for the shooting of another man, who was allegedly holding a handgun at the time.

Daily Caller reporter Richard McGinnis, who administered first aid to the first man shot, is a key witness in the complaint.

The complaint describes the shootings in detail:

The first man shot and killed was Joseph Rosenbaum, who is described as chasing Rittenhouse across a parking lot. In a video, the complaint said, Rosenbaum “appears to throw an object” at Rittenhouse, which appeared to be a plastic bag and did not hit him. After a loud bang was heard on the video, Rosenbaum continued to pursue Rittenhouse until he was shot. McGinnis is quoted in the complaint as saying that Rosenbaum appeared to be trying to grab the gun from Rittenhouse.

McGinnis adds that he had just spoken to Rittenhouse and advised him that he was not handling his weapon well when Rosenbaum and other people began chasing Rittenhouse. No provocation for the pursuit is described in the pursuit.

The complaint then describes Rittenhouse running away from a large group of people, some of whom were attacking him and shouting things such as, “Get him! Get that dude!” and “Beat him up!”. During the melee, the second man shot and killed, Anthony Huber, is described as having attacked Rittenhouse with a skateboard after the latter had fallen to the ground. Huber is also described as having attempted to grab Rittenhouse’s gun before being shot once and later dying from that wound.

A third man, Gaige Grosskreutz, is also described as having approached Rittenhouse. At first, according to the complaint, Grosskreutz raised his hands in a gesture of surrender, then continued approaching and appeared to be holding a handgun. He was then shot in the right arm.

Rittenhouse also faces a charge of recklessly endangering safety through the use of a dangerous weapon, based on the claim that McGinnis was in the line of fire when Rittenhouse first shot his attacker. According to the complaint, McGinnis thought he himself may have been shot at the time. Another charge of recklessly endangering safety refers to an unknown individual who is described as having been in the line of fire later in the confrontation.

Rittenhouse is also charged with a firearms violation for possession of a dangerous weapon under age 18, with a minimum penalty of nine months in jail. He faces six criminal counts overall.

On Friday, Rittenhouse is scheduled to appear in court in Lake County, Illinois, for an extradition hearing that will allow him to be tried in Wisconsin. He is a resident of Antioch, Illinois.

From the NBC transcript:

Melvin: You devoted a fair amount of your speech to the [COVID-19] virus. And you talked about the national mask mandate. It sounds like that would be one of the first orders of business. Harris: Yes. Melvin: How would you enforce that? Harris: It’s really — it’s a standard. Nobody’s going to be punished. Come on. Nobody likes to wear a mask. This is a universal feeling. Right? So that’s not the point. Hey, let’s enjoy wearing masks. No. The point is this is what we as responsible people who love our neighbor, we have to just do that right now.

365,http://www.breitbart.com/2020-election/2020/08/28/blue-state-blues-power-hungry-pelosi-has-to-go/,2020-08-28T00:00:00,breitbart,"Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) reminded Americans on Thursday why she is such a toxic presence in Congress.

In her weekly press conference, Pelosi suggested that former Vice President Joe Biden should not debate President Donald Trump this fall. “I wouldn’t legitimize a conversation with him nor a debate in terms of the presidency of the United States,” she added.

On one level, Pelosi was articulating the growing fear among Democrats that Biden can’t beat Trump — at least, not fairly. There was also gamesmanship involved: if Biden has to debate Trump, best to set expectations as low as possible.

But Pelosi also made clear that nearly four years into the Trump presidency, she still refuses to regard him as the legitimate, elected leader. She also thinks the voters do not deserve to see the candidates face off against one another in a public forum.

This is how Pelosi has treated the electorate, and her own party, for years. And her behavior has become worse over time.

She was first elected Speaker in 2006, the first woman ever to rise to that powerful position, in charge of the nation’s purse strings and third in line for the presidency. She and her party took Congress promising to “drain the swamp” of corruption.

But Pelosi immediately broke that promise, backing Rep. Jack Murtha (D-PA) for the post of House Majority Leader, whom the Wall Street Journal described as steeped in the “culture of corruption.” (He eventually lost to Rep. Steny Hoyer (D-MD).

For two years, Pelosi regarded her job as treading water until the 2008 election, when Democrats would have the chance to take complete control of Washington. Meanwhile, she consolidated power to an unprecedented degree in the Speaker’s office.

After 2008, she pushed through unprecedented liberal legislation: the $862 billion stimulus; the $400 billion omnibus; cap-and-trade (which went nowhere in the Senate); and the ultimate left-wing dream, the Affordable Care Act — Obamacare.

The latter cost Pelosi control of the House, as outraged voters, led by the Tea Party, marched to the polls and delivered a huge Republican victory. In most other democracies, that loss would have prompted Pelosi to resign in favor of new leadership.

But not Pelosi. She was determined to maintain power. She defeated every leadership challenge — from Rep. Health Shuler (D-NC) to Tim Ryan (D-OH) — and tightened her grip on her party, hoping one day that she would seize the gavel again.

That day came in 2019, after Democrats returned to power in the House. Pelosi faced a new challenge in the form of a cohort of far-left radicals — the so-called “Squad.” She deftly negotiated for their support, promising to serve only two more terms.

Her ambition is to return to the position she and Democrats had in 2009, after Obama won. She knows that she could be the effective leader of the country, with the hapless, geriatric Joe Biden managed by a team of party fixers at the White House.

To that end, she has planted the idea that she is already “co-equal” to the president in terms of the Constitution. She has also blocked everything that anyone else has tried to do — and not just President Trump. When a bipartisan team of Senators had reached a deal on the second round of coronavirus relief, Pelosi jetted in from her luxury mansion in San Francisco, declared her contempt for the Senate’s work, and released an 1,815-page bill of special interest giveaways and partisan power grabs.

Along the way, Pelosi also impeached the president. She rushed to open the inquiry — before she had seen the evidence — then delayed the articles of impeachment for weeks. It was one of the worst and most cynical abuses of power in the sorry history of the Beltway. She could have been remembered for Obamacare; Obama himself said he was willing to lose to pass it. Instead, Pelosi will be remembered for her pursuit of power. Voters could vindicate her ambitions — or send her packing.

She did not identify any laws that were allegedly broken by the RNC’s operations.

Clinton cited a death count similar to the latest claim from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The CDC currently categorizes 160,000 deaths as “involving COVID-19.”

Clinton wrote, “What we saw last night sums up so much of the Trump administration: A law-breaking convention on your dime, on the lawn of your house, to celebrate a president like a king for overseeing the needless deaths of 180,000 Americans—and counting.”

Clinton attached a photo of protesters forming a message reading, “TRUMP FAILED 180000+ DIED.”

Left-wing and Democrat-aligned news media critiqued what they claimed was a lack of “social distancing” and mask-wearing at the RNC. The Washington Post published an article titled, “Few masks, little distancing: Trump celebrates at crowded White House party largely devoid of coronavirus precautions.” CNN ran a headline reading, “Few masks, lack of social distancing at final night of RNC.” ABC declared, “What virus? At GOP’s convention, pandemic is largely ignored.”

Christine Pelosi, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s eldest daughter, characterized the RNC as “illegal” due to “no masks” and “no distancing.” Her Twitter profile image is a photo of her wearing a mask.

Judge Ian Thornhill’s ruling prompted election officials to resend applications to thousands of voters due to issues with the originals, according to CBS 46.

The report continued:

The judge sided with the Trump campaign and the Republican Party, which filed a lawsuit this month seeking to discard the absentee ballot request forms. The Trump campaign argued the forms should have been blank except for the election date and type, per the Iowa secretary of state’s directions. Local officials in Linn County, which is home to Cedar Rapids, ignored those directions and sent out the applications with more information anyway.

Thornhill’s temporary injunction ordered Linn County Auditor Joel Miller, a Democrat, to notify voters that the forms should not have been pre-filled with their information and therefore could not be processed, according to NBC News.

Voters would need to fill out a new request for an absentee ballot or vote on Election Day, the report stated, adding:

Republicans said the ruling would hold a “rogue auditor” accountable and enhance voting security, while outraged Democrats called it an act of voter suppression. Miller said he would abide by the order, pledging to void the returned requests and send out new blank forms to voters next month.

There was similar litigation awaiting a decision in Woodbury and Johnson counties where auditors also sent pre-filled forms, but Thornhill’s ruling affected Linn County only, according to CBS 2 Iowa.

The ruling stated:

It is implausible to conclude that near total completion of an absentee ballot application by the auditor is authorized under Iowa law where the legislature has specifically forbidden government officials from partially completing the same document. Not every county can afford the prepopulated request forms.

Republican National Committee Chair Ronna McDaniel praised the move in a statement Thursday and said it upheld “a key voter protection mechanism and will help to ensure Iowa’s elections are free, fair and transparent.”","Iowa Judge Voids 50,000 Absentee Ballot Requests",fake

The survey, fielded August 14-23 among 1,048 likely general election voters, showed President Trump edging out his competitor in the Wolverine State — 46.6 percent to 45.2 percent:

Trump’s edge is within the survey’s +/- 2.98 percent margin of error. Notably, the survey was taken prior to the Republican National Convention, meaning the current poll does not reflect a post-convention bump. It was, however, fielded during last week’s Democratic National Convention.

Trafalgar Group released another survey earlier this week, examining the state of the presidential race in Wisconsin, another swing state. The survey also gave Trump a slight edge, showing likely general election voters backing the president 46.2 percent to Biden’s 45.4 percent. Those survey results were taken prior to the unrest in Kenosha, Wisconsin, but it comes as support for the Black Lives Matter Movement continues to dip.

As Breitbart News reported:

In a statewide poll conducted between June 14 and June 18, the Marquette Law School Poll showed 61 percent of Wisconsin voters approved of the Black Lives Matter protests, while 36 percent disapproved of those protest. By a margin of 25 points, more Wisconsin voters approved of BLM than disapproved of BLM. That same Marquette Law School poll conducted in Jun showed Joe Biden leading Donald Trump by 6 points in the state, 50 percent to 44 percent. In a subsequent statewide poll conducted between August 4 and August 9, the Marquette Law School Poll saw approval drop 13 points, from 61 percent to 48 percent, while disapproval jumped by 12 points, from 36 percent to 48 percent. Stunningly, the net margin of approval versus disapproval among Wisconsin voters of BLM has dropped from plus 25 to zero in just two months.

It is possible the trend could be reflected in Michigan, as protests and mass looting flared up in Minneapolis this week, sparked by the suicide of a homicide suspect.

While some consider Trafalgar Group to be a right-leaning pollster, RealClearPolitics has flagged it as “a polling firm to watch as Trump’s 2020 re-election bid heats up” due to its record in 2016, correctly showing Trump leading in both Pennsylvania and Michigan.

A short video released by the Trump campaign Twitter account highlighted the president’s record on improving public housing in New York and other cities.

“My name is Judy Smith,” said one black woman, who continued:

I live in New York City public housing. I’m grateful for the spotlight that President Trump is putting on New York City public housing. I think it’s wrong that the Democrats put illegal immigrants before black Americans. How is it that we have people waiting on the waiting lists for New York City public housing for 10 years or more, but yet we have illegal immigrants living here?

President Trump is bringing real solutions to real problems.#RNC2020 pic.twitter.com/3Q7s2ZEchE — Team Trump (Text VOTE to 88022) (@TeamTrump) August 28, 2020

The comments were likely aimed at working-class blacks in many swing states, including several Midwest states.

“Working-class African Americans are significantly more supportive of policies that seek to: decrease the number of immigrants coming to the United States, increase the federal role in verifying the employment status of immigrants, and attempts to amend the Constitution’s citizenship provisions,” said a 2013 peer-reviewed study by Tatishe Nteta, a professor at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst. The study continued:

For African Americans who lost a job to an immigrant, working-class membership resulted in a 13 percentage point increase in the probability of support for an increased federal role in workplace oversight [against employment of illegal immigrants] when compared to middle-class African Americans who experienced a similar loss.

Numerous polls show that blacks — like all other groups — say they wish to welcome migrants, but strongly prefer that Americans get jobs before companies import more migrants.

Nationwide, the expanded supply of new migrants also cuts Americans’ disposable wages by inflating their housing costs. That reality is recognized by investor groups who are urging more immigration. For example, the Economic Innovation Group says, “The relationship between population growth and housing demand is clear. More people means more demand for housing, and fewer people means less demand.”

Mike Bloomberg’s pro-migration advocacy group, New American Economy, pushed the same argument:

The research shows that an increase in the absolute number of immigrants in a particular county from 2000–2010 results in corresponding economic gains—increased demand for locally produced goods and services, a corresponding inflow of U.S.-born individuals—that are reflected in the housing market.

The video also included comments from other blacks in New York:

My name is Manuel Martinez … Under the Trump administration, New York City Housing Authority has received an influx of cash that it has not seen since 1997. My name is Claudia Perez I’m the resident council president of Washington Houses, which is in Spanish Harlem. [New York Mayor] Bill de Blasio and the way he has dealt with public housing residents is disgraceful. President Trump administration has opened their ears and has listened … [and] is bringing real solutions to real problems.

Moreover, we Catholics should remind ourselves that while we may judge the objective moral quality of another’s actions, we must never question the sincerity of another’s faith, which is due to the mysterious working of grace in that person’s heart. In this fractious time, let us remember that our highest calling is to love.

C-SPAN

Holtz said in his address to the Republican National Convention on Wednesday that he is supporting President Donald Trump’s re-election because of his administration’s pro-life stance:

One of the important reasons he has my trust is because nobody has been a stronger advocate for the unborn than President Trump. The Biden-Harris ticket is the most radically pro-abortion campaign in history. They and other politicians are “Catholics in Name Only” and abandon innocent lives. President Trump protects those lives.

While Biden professes to be a Catholic, he has promised to defend abortion rights, which the abortion industry refers to as “women’s healthcare,” and has committed to embracing the Democrat Party’s pro-abortion agenda that includes codifying Roe v. Wade, fully funding Planned Parenthood, and forcing American taxpayers to fund abortions.

Recently, the Catholic League rebuked Biden for doubling down on his support for abortion and dismissing demands from pro-life Democrats to eliminate their party’s abortion agenda.

Last October, Biden was denied communion at a Roman Catholic Church in South Carolina.

Holtz also referred to Trump as an “outstanding leader.”

In the president’s formal acceptance speech Thursday evening, he continued his commitment to the unborn:

Joe Biden claims he has empathy for the vulnerable – yet the party he leads supports the extreme late-term abortion of defenseless babies right up to the moment of birth. Democrat leaders talk about moral decency, but they have no problem with stopping a baby’s beating heart in the 9th month of pregnancy.

“Democrat politicians refuse to protect innocent life, and then they lecture us about morality and saving America’s soul?” the president questioned. “Tonight, we proudly declare that all children, born and unborn, have a God-given right to life.”

“An official Israeli delegation will go to Abu Dhabi on a direct El Al flight for the first time ever,” a spokesman for Israel’s national carrier said, noting the flight from Tel Aviv was set for Monday.

Jared Kushner, top aide and son-in-law to US President Donald Trump, has confirmed he will be on the flight, alongside National Security Advisor Robert O’Brien.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said that National Security Advisor Meir Ben Shabbat will be leading the “professional delegation”.

Among other findings, the poll said nearly 50 percent of Chinese think India is too economically dependent upon China, an assessment many Indians would agree with.

Given that China is a totalitarian state and the Global Times publishes content exclusively favorable to the Chinese Communist Party, the authenticity of the poll is difficult, if impossible, to verify – making the statistic showing Chinese people agreeing with many in India that the country should not rely so much on the Chinese economy a peculiar data point.

The poll provided a cornucopia of Chinese nationalist sentiment, including large majorities who felt “anti-China sentiment in India is excessive,” India’s military is no threat to China, and India’s “national strength” will never surpass that of China.

According to the poll, the second-worst obstacle in relations between India and China is “U.S. interference,” followed closely by India’s unreasonable hostility toward China.

35 percent of respondents said they were angry about India’s #BoycottChina movement and urged their government to retaliate, while 29 percent said India “isn’t serious” about the effort so it should be ignored.

Over 89 percent of respondents supported “China’s use of force to fight back in self-defense” if there is “another border conflict.” Chinese propaganda holds India as the aggressor in the bloody June brawl along the border in the Galwan Valley, while India accuses the Chinese of encroaching on their territory.

The Global Times sought to put a happy face on their poll by including some optimism about the future of India-China relations – provided the Indians behave themselves:

The survey also showed that 25 percent of the participants are optimistic about bilateral relations as they believe “China-India ties will be improved in the long term” even as 70.8 percent of them recognized that currently, Indians are being too hostile against China. This result somewhat surprised Chinese experts. [China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations director Hu Shinseng] said China-India relations will see lots of ups and downs, and although India is unlikely to start an all-out confrontation against China, it will make trouble occasionally in the China-India border regions. “The optimistic attitude of some Chinese people toward China-India relations is probably based on the confidence in China’s comprehensive national strength, which is much greater than India’s. Normally, the stronger side would have a more confident and optimistic attitude to its relations with other countries,” Hu noted.

The Chinese state media article labored to imply India’s unreasoning hostility to China is born of India’s ignorance, lavishing praise on Chinese citizens for how well they supposedly understand and appreciate Indian culture – their fondness for Bollywood movies and yoga exercises was specifically mentioned, although they are supposedly concerned about “the dire situation facing Indian women, such as horrific rape cases that are widely and frequently reported by international media.”

Poll respondents ranked India – the country they supposedly want punished for foolishly picking fights with Beijing – as their fourth-favorite neighbor after Russia, Pakistan, and Japan. This was said to demonstrate that “Chinese people can rationally separate the Indian government, which is provoking China, from the innocent Indian culture and people.”

India and China are still attempting to de-escalate tensions on their border, but tensions remain high, “disengagement” of forces appears to have stalled, and Indian officials are accusing the Chinese of making “exaggerated and untenable claims.”

Much of India’s messaging is aimed at convincing the Chinese they would not have an easy victory if they provoke a military conflict along the Line of Actual Control (LAC). The chief minister of Punjab, Capt. Amarinder Singh, warned on Wednesday that if China starts a war, Pakistan would soon be drawn in as well.

“I think it’s time for talent, writers, executives, the guild and SAG to show up for Black lives as well,” Cullors said. “Join this strike. Now is the time and our movement is really looking to unions to step in in a particular way and say ‘We’re going to hold back on allowing for the exploitation and the degradation of Black communities to continue under our watch.’ I think Hollywood can really show up in this moment.”

Cullors, who is also a playwright, made the remarks in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter after the NBA’s Milwaukee Bucks boycotted their playoff game on Tuesday after Blake was shot seven times by police. The strike led to other teams from Major League Basketball, the National Hockey League, and Major League Soccer to join in the boycott.

Cullors didn’t explain how a Hollywood strike would look but said BLM leaders are currently in discussion with some industry executives to establish what would be possible.

“People are tired of having to say the same thing over and over again, and not seeing the change that we deserve from either party, frankly,” she says. “I think the work that we’re up against right now is to ensure that we can get Trump out of office, but also ensure that we can get the Democratic Party to truly create policies that will make sure that Black people are protected from vigilantes and from police torture.”

However, the feasibility of Cullor’s Hollywood strike demands remain in doubt. After months of a coronavirus lockdown, the entertainment industry is now gearing itself up to reopening movie theaters. Major networks are also announcing the return of shows and their production.

A Hollywood strike would also inflict major harm on the industry’s economy and further harm already out of work blue-collar workers, many of whom are black, whose livelihood has already been badly affected by the global pandemic.

After recounting the actions that led to the NBA’s suspension of games for the rest of the week, Hill noted that the players took criticism.

“On social media and cable news, some fans and commentators heaped scorn upon the players for walking out in the first place, depicting them as selfish athletes who were only throwing a tantrum for the sake of virtue signaling,” Hill wrote.

Hill added that there is a narrative that says, “athletes, because of their social and economic status, are a privileged class with no right to complain.”

This narrative is “racist,” Hill insisted, because “the idea of telling Black athletes—or any prominent Black person—to be grateful is almost as old as racism itself.”

“What critics… ignore,” Hill wrote, “is that the NBA is a predominantly Black league and that just because its Black players are professional athletes, that doesn’t protect them from police violence and harassment.”

After noting that several NBA players have been injured or harassed by police, Hill added famous athletes are in “an ideal position to speak for Black men and women who don’t have the same advantages.”

With that in mind, Hill segued back to Wednesday’s “impromptu strike” in the NBA that was echoed across the WNBA and Major League Baseball. Hill praised this response to the Blake shooting and finally warmed to her central point.

“This was a historic act. Black athletes—and some allies of other races—sent the message that America doesn’t get to enjoy their talents if it can’t respect Black people as human beings,” she said shrilly.

Hill added that many players are realizing that all their activism for Black Lives Matter, their slogans on jerseys, and their donated money isn’t fostering any “change” they claim to seek. She claims that the feeling inside the NBA “bubble” in Florida where all the players are holed up to play the COVID quarantined season is one of “mental exhaustion.” Hill insisted that “something broke inside these players” after the Blake shooting.

So, the boycott was their solution, and Hill says it was “right” and every other black athlete should join the NBA:

Despite the potential financial risks, the players were right to explore whether they could grab America’s attention by withholding their services. Had the NBA players opted to carry out a long-term strike, just imagine what that might have looked like: They play in cities that depend on the revenue they generate. Perhaps upon feeling the financial strain, officials in those cities might have been more motivated to reimagine their police force. Perhaps NBA owners might have been so bothered by losing money that they would have used their power and connections to put pressure on the right people to change the status quo. An extended strike also would have put pressure on NFL players to act. Pro football is by far the most popular sport in America. Nearly 70 percent of its players are Black. If Black NFL players followed the NBA players’ lead, a big chunk of the sports economy would be made contingent on racial progress.

Hill concluded on a note of celebration:

“At the very least, this week’s historic disruption shows that Black players should leverage their talent to promote change at every possible opportunity. They’ve tried to sweet-talk America into caring about racial injustice, but the litany continues,” she crooned.

“When a country doesn’t respect Black lives, it can’t expect Black athletes to hold back their anger,” she finished exultantly.

Only one thing that Hill didn’t bother to address. And that is, just what “change” have any of these multi-millionaire players affected? Sure, they have called every white person a racist, called the country evil, claimed everyone hates them — even though everyone has given them billions to play sports. But, what actual good has all this arm-waving and hate-spewing actually achieved?

Maybe most people don’t have much interest in each little thought coursing through every last random athlete’s mind, and they are only interested in the game to which those athletes have dedicated their lives?

Maybe the athletes’ real frustration is their late realization that few people care what they have to say about deep subjects? Worse, perhaps people resent being called irredeemably racist by millionaire players and Atlantic writers?

Jim Trotter of NFL Media noted on Friday that “[a] few prominent Black players are telling me they want to sit out a game to make their feelings felt & force change/action.”

NFL owners should be careful. A few prominent Black players are telling me they want to sit out a game to make their feelings felt & force change/action. They are tired, frustrated and emotional. It’s only a few at this point, but sparks become flames & flames become infernos. — Jim Trotter (@JimTrotter_NFL) August 28, 2020

The NFL is only about two weeks away from the league’s first game in its shortened 2020 season, but after the NBA, WNBA, MLB, and NHL all canceled games when players demanded a response to the police-involved shooting of Jacob Blake in Wisconsin, it now appears that the NFL wants in on the act too.

Pro sports began responding to the Blake shooting this week. On Wednesday, The Milwaukee Bucks led the NBA into a boycott of playoff games as players across the league announced frustration that all their activism has had little impact.

Wednesday’s boycott led to a cancellation of games for the week, though the players later came together and voted to continue the end of the season.

Basketball was not alone. Major League Baseball also began canceling games, as did the WNBA. Following all that, the NHL postponed several playoff games amid protests over the Blake shooting.

The NFL has also made several statements about the shooting. This week, various NFL teams refused to take the practice field in protest.

Left-wing sports analyst Mike Florio wondered if it might not be better for the players to go ahead and play and use “the platform to send clear messages before, after, and during games that both raise awareness and call for specific change.”

But, the problem with that idea is that no NFL player has called for any specific change to anything. Instead, they throw it around as if the word “change” itself is some sort of panacea. That and fewer people every day are interested in what pampered millionaire athletes have to say about anything.

The comedian fired off more than 15 five-alarm tweets in which he railed against the commander in chief as a “con man” and “rapist.” He also sounded off on the subjects of cancel culture, Trump Derangement Syndrome, and virtue signaling.

Jim Gaffigan, whose comedy special The Pale Tourist recently debuted on Amazon Prime Video, warned of an economic apocalypse if President Trump wins re-election in November, adding that a Trump victory will mean that it’s all “over.”

“To those of you who think Im destroying my career wake up. if trump gets elected, the economy will never come back,” he said in an epic tweetstorm.

“You know if Trump gets re-elected it’s over. How many books have to be written?” he added.

Jim Gaffigan began his tirade late Thursday night. “Look Trumpers I get it. As a kid I was a cubs fan and I know you stick by your team no matter what but he’s a traitor and a con man who doesn’t care about you,” he tweeted. “Deep down you know it. I’m sure you enjoy pissing people off but you know Trump is a liar and a criminal.”

He then fired off 15 more tweets before calling it a night.

You know he lies. Constantly. Yet you dont care? What because he insults people that make you and me feel dumb? — Jim Gaffigan (@JimGaffigan) August 28, 2020

In his most incendiary tweet, Gaffigan accused President Trump of being a “rapist.” The comedian also attacked retired football coach Lou Holtz, who gave his support to the president during the convention.

Fuck Lou Holtz. Biden is Catholic in name only? Compared to who? How many abortions did trump pay for? How many women has he raped? How many times did pull the shit he did in Ukraine. Wake up. He's a crook and a con man. — Jim Gaffigan (@JimGaffigan) August 28, 2020

What bravery from the cowards who are against equal justice. Wake up. Don't you know history will make you the fool. — Jim Gaffigan (@JimGaffigan) August 28, 2020

At another point, Gaffigan insisted that he wasn’t part of the “Hollywood” crowd, despite having a new show with Amazon Studios and having had his own sitcom, The Jim Gaffigan Show, on the ViacomCBS-owned TV Land.

can we stop with this HOLLYWOOD shit. I'm not from Hollywood and Hollywood is just a town.

You know if Trump gets re-elected it's over. How many books have to be written? — Jim Gaffigan (@JimGaffigan) August 28, 2020

Before signing off, Gaffigan denied the existence of the Deep State and “Trump Derangement Syndrome,” saying the latter is just a distraction from “the con of Don.”

In Particular, the Times notes that Breitbart News posts have been shared 4 million times in the past 30 days, “roughly three times as many as posts from the official pages of every Democratic member of the U.S. Senate combined.”

Despite Facebook’s pattern of censorship against the pro-Trump right, including bans of prominent Trump supporters and removals of Trump ads, conservative media continues to perform well on the platform, a fact the New York Times now admits.

Via NYT:

Every morning, one of the first browser tabs I open is CrowdTangle — a handy Facebook-owned data tool that offers a bird’s-eye view of what’s popular on the platform. I check which politicians and pundits are going viral. I geek out on trending topics. I browse the previous day’s stories to see which got the most reactions, shares and comments. Most days, the leader board looks roughly the same: conservative post after conservative post, with the occasional liberal interloper.

The NYT also notes that Breitbart News outperforms every Democrat senator, combined:

Facebook posts by Breitbart, the far-right news outlet, have been shared four million times in the past 30 days, roughly three times as many as posts from the official pages of every Democratic member of the U.S. Senate combined.

In a comment to the Times, a Facebook spokesman attempted to downplay the success of conservatives, hinting that high engagement doesn’t necessarily mean the posts are getting seen by a wider Facebook audience.

“These points look mostly at how people engage with content, which should not be confused with how many people actually see it on Facebook,” said Facebook spokesman Joe Osborne in his statement.

Johnson was granted clemency by President Trump after celebrity Kim Kardashian advocated for Johnson’s release from a life sentence on a drug conspiracy and money laundering conviction.

Partial transcript as follows:

RUHLE: Joining me, my dear friend Alice Johnson. Always good to see you. Until now, you have been very careful. you’ve always said you’re a criminal justice advocate but you didn’t want to get political. Speaking at the RNC is as political as it gets. why did you change your mind?

JOHNSON: It was a great opportunity to get the message across the nation to support criminal justice reform. And as I said in my speech last night, my dear friend, I made a promise to the women who I left behind and also the men that I would never stop fighting for them whenever and wherever it takes me.

RUHLE: But it’s more than saying you’re fighting for criminal justice reform. By endorsing President Trump, you’re saying he is the person who is fighting for criminal justice reform. You don’t believe Joe Biden would?

JOHNSON: I don’t know what Joe Biden would do. I just know that with this administration they’ve been open to the things I’ve been bringing to the table. So I’m so focused on my mission that I’m not going to speak on what Joe Biden will or will not do. I’m going to speak to what I know.

RUHLE: Your speech seemed to make the most compelling case that President Trump say compassionate person. Do you believe other people in the African-American community believe that he’s compassionate, especially given his law and order policies?

JOHNSON: Well, even law and order must be underpinned by justice and mercy. You know, and many people who I’ve talked to, they are very, very compelled by what he did for me and the compassion that he showed for me. I wouldn’t dare speak to what other people think. I just know what I feel, and that I know he had compassion upon me and I know my situation moved him to act. When I speak, Stephanie, I speak from a personal place. I can’t speak to anyone else.

RUHLE: The president highlighted last night his executive order demanding ten-year prison sentences for anyone convicted of tearing down statues and monuments, including confederate statues. How does that square with his criminal justice reform? Ten years.

JOHNSON: I mean, that was the first time that I heard that. And I don’t know what his full policy is. I’m not just trying to be careful, but I don’t want to speak out of turn. And so that’s why I can’t say that because that was my first time hearing that.

RUHLE: I can say that I certainly appreciate that you are no longer in prison and you’re with your family. Last night you were sitting in the audience on the white house lawn for President Trump’s speech. Most of the people around you were not wearing masks. Can i ask you, were you tested for coronavirus beforehand?

JOHNSON: Yes, I’ve been tested. I was tested before I went in there. So I had a mask on and the people around me who I was sitting with, they had been tested.

RUHLE: Good. You know I want you to be safe, Alice.

JOHNSON: Oh, yes, I know. I had my mask. As soon as I got up, I put that mask back on.

RUHLE: Good. When I watched last night, I thought my girl Alice better have a mask. I want her safe.

JOHNSON: Oh, I did. I had one right there.

RUHLE: You had a chance, I’m glad, to deliver your message to an enormous audience, to the country. What do you hope viewers took away from your speech?

JOHNSON: I hope that they took away that there are many others like me who deserve a second chance and also my message to them that there is redemption. That there’s so many others who deserve a second chance and not to just look at us as being disposable because they don’t see us. so every time people see my face, I hope that they’re reminded of the faces of others.

RUHLE: Alice, you had said you don’t know what Joe Biden would do in terms of criminal justice reform. Has his campaign reached out to you? And if they, do would you be opening to talking to him?

JOHNSON: His campaign has not reached out to me. I would like to know everyone’s plan what they have. I’ve been working with the White House on what their plans on, and I feel good about them. So no one has reached out to me from his organization, from his campaign.

Welcome to LegoGate.

During her speech introducing her father at Thursday’s RNC, Ivanka Trump told the story of her three-year-old son, Joseph, building a White House out of Legos and gifting it to his grandfather, who also happens to be the President of the United States.

“When Jared and I moved with our three children to Washington, we didn’t exactly know what we were in for. But our kids loved it from the start,” she said. “My son Joseph promptly built grandpa a Lego replica of the White House. The president still displays it on the mantel in the Oval Office and shows it to world leaders, just so they know he has the greatest grandchildren on earth.”

Naturally, the fake news media could not allow this to stand.

Too warm.

Too humanizing.

Not enough Orange Man Bad.

It took two people — two! — at Business Insider to break the fake bombshell that “if the Lego White House is real, where is it?”

See? Lots of statues. No Lego White Houses. Bloomberg News’s White House editor, Alex Wayne, tweeted that none of his outlet’s reporters have ever seen the Lego White House:

Our reporters are in the Oval Office nearly every day. None of them have ever seen the Lego White House. — Alex Wayne (@aawayne) August 28, 2020

Where is it? Where is it?

Other members of the Blue Checkmark Media Mafia immediately lost their diseased minds.

Another crack journalist named Andrea Bernstein believed she had cracked the case.

“OMG, Ivanka is telling a story about her son Joseph building a lego model of the White House. She told the same story about herself once, building a lego Trump Tower,” Bernstein tweeted and screen-capped an excerpt from her anti-Trump book called something-something something-something Oligarchs.

Bernstein claimed her except was proof Ivanka lied.

Except…

The excerpt is an anecdote about Ivanka building a replica of Trump Tower out of Legos and something about her evil father fuming over what she got wrong and something else about that anecdote not even being true and then the black helicopters arrived and took me to my special place.

First off, we have to assume this tale in something-something Oligarchs is true, or not true as the case may be. My head hurts. But even if it is true, is Bernstein unfamiliar with the way in which parents often pass on traditions to their children?

Maybe a normal person could inform Bernstein that normal people would look at a story of Ivanka gifting her dad with a Lego replica as pretty solid evidence her son would do the same thing.

Oh, and by the way, here’s a photo of Joseph’s White House made out of Legos sitting in the Oval Office. The photo was taken before Ivanka gave her speech.

There it is right there.

It’s right freakin’ there…

Business Insider was forced to update its fake news.

But if you think this is the end of LegoGate, of holding a three-year-old up to the mob and slowly pulling his wings off, then you are obviously unfamiliar with the American political media.

Now that we have proof there is indeed a White House made of Legos in the Oval Office, it can mean only one thing… It’s still all a lie.

To the FactCheckingMobile…

“Ivanka Trump has tweeted a photo of her son, Joseph, with his grandfather at the Resolute Desk with the Lego White House,” Bernstein tweeted a few hours ago. “I’ve asked the White House if 3-year old Joseph indeed built it of his own initiative, and if he had assistance”:

I’m not making that up. That’s a real tweet from a “real journalist” published at ProPublica.

Paul was among the guests at President Donald Trump’s speech on the South Lawn of the White House accepting his party’s nomination. Protesters attempted to drown out the speech, and later harassed people leaving the event.

Paul and his companions were prevented from moving for several minutes, and were surrounded by police — as well as by protesters screaming at them, demanding that they say the name of Breonna Taylor, who was killed by police in Louisville earlier this year.

The Senator and the others stood silently for several minutes, wearing masks.

Some held signs that read “Good Trouble,” “Stop Killing Us,” and “Black Lives Matter.” One of the sign-holders raised a middle finger.

“It’s Rand Paul, and he won’t say Breonna Taylor’s name!” one shouted.

“You can’t acknowledge Breonna Taylor ever existed! That’s disgusting!” another yelled.

D.C. Metropolitan Police eventually formed a phalanx around Paul and moved through the crowd slowly, some carrying bicycles. Paul and the women traveling with him linked arms to avoid being separated from one another by the unruly demonstrators, who continued to shout at the Senator.

Paul later tweeted:

“Are you a black Trump supporter?” one asked. “You’re a fucking disgrace! Shame!” another shouted at Jones.

Police carrying bicycles formed a protective circle around Jones and his companion, moving them slowly down the street.

Evers, under the Emergency Management Assistance Compact (EMAC), requested states assist Wisconsin as authorities gear up for what could be a violent weekend in Kenosha.

EMAC is a mutual aid agreement that allows governors to provide state-to-state assistance during declared states of emergency. It will enable other states to provide resources such as National Guard troops and equipment to the requesting state,” the press release states.

As a result, three states — Arizona, Michigan, and Alabama — will send National Guard troops to assist the Wisconsin National Guard:

Any National Guard troops from other states mobilized to support Wisconsin would do so in a State Active Duty status — not in a federal status. Those troops would fall under the operational control of Wisconsin’s adjutant general during their mobilization, but remain under their respective State’s administrative control. … Local officials are leading the response in Kenosha, and National Guard troops are serving in a support role to assist civil authorities in preserving public safety and individuals’ ability to exercise their First Amendment rights to assemble peaceably.

Local authorities originally requested 750 National Guard members earlier this week, but Evers only authorized 250 and rejected the White House’s offer for further assistance. After a particularly violent night, which saw two shot dead and another wounded, Evers authorized additional resources to support local authorities.

The Department of Justice also deployed “federal assets, including from the FBI and US Marshals” to assist in the response to the violent riots, DOJ spokesman Keri Kupec confirmed on Wednesday:

Evers has since pleaded with demonstrators, asking them to protest “peacefully and safely.”

Jim Banks (R-IN) is introducing legislation this week, Breitbart News has learned, to strip convicted rioters of federal unemployment benefits and have them pay the cost of federal policing of riots.

Banks’ legislation, known as the Support Peaceful Protest Act, would ensure that rioters convicted of violence, vandalism, or looting must pay restitution to cover the cost of federal law enforcement policing of the riot at which they were arrested.

In addition, Banks’ plan would mandate that convicted rioters become ineligible for federal unemployment benefits during the Chinese coronavirus crisis. Some are currently receiving hundreds of dollars in extra unemployment benefits.

“Antifa thugs are descending on suffering communities, disrupting peaceful protests and leaving violence, looting, and vandalism in their wake,” Banks said in a statement. “They turned Milwaukee, Seattle, and Portland into warzones, and now they’re moving the chaos to Kenosha, Wisconsin. Who knows which community is next?”

“Due to enhanced federal benefits, taxpayers are giving wages to jobless rioters that are destroying our communities,” Banks said. “We need to cut them off from their funding and make them feel the full financial consequences of their actions.”

Banks’ legislation comes as rioting has continued in Portland, Oregon and since broken out in Kenosha County, Wisconsin. In Kenosha, local law enforcement asked for 750 United States National Guard members to help restore law and order, but Gov. Tony Evers (D) only sent about 250.

On Thursday evening, Black Lives Matter and Antifa protesters stood outside the White House and accosted attendees of President Donald Trump’s speech for the Republican National Convention (RNC). Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) and State Rep. Vernon Jones (D-GA) were both harassed and surrounded by protesters.

In a Thursday statement, Bishop Shelton J. Fabre, chairman of the Bishops’ Committee Against Racism, called on Americans to seek racial justice “peacefully” with respect for the inherent dignity of every person.

Citing Archbishop Jerome E. Listecki of Milwaukee, who oversees the City of Kenosha, Bishop Fabre said that violence “can never be the means to attain peace and justice.”

“The sins of violence, injustice, racism, and hatred must be purged from our communities with acts of mercy, with the protection and care for the dignity of every human person, with respect for the common good, and with an unwavering pursuit of equality and peace,” he quoted.

In his statement, Bishop Fabre also underscored the implicit racism of the U.S. abortion industry, which overwhelmingly targets blacks.

“We reiterate the value of those whose human life and dignity in this country are marginalized through racism and our need to fight for them including the unborn,” he said.

America’s largest abortion provider, Planned Parenthood, has continued targeting minority communities in line with the original racist aims of the organization.

Shortly before the 2016 U.S. presidential election, a group of prominent black Christian clergy and intellectuals wrote an “open letter” to Democrat Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, denouncing her complicity in America’s abortion crisis, which they said has had a “catastrophic impact” on the black community.

“Black babies are dying at terrifying rates,” stated the 26 black leaders, including eight bishops. “Don’t black lives matter?”

In their letter, the leaders noted that the rate of abortion among blacks is far higher than among whites, with “365 black babies aborted for every 1,000 that are born.”

“Blacks account for roughly 38% of all abortions in the country though we represent only 13% of the population,” they said, citing statistics that have led black Christian leaders to speak of a “black genocide” occurring at the hands of abortionists.

By functional standards, abortion is the most racist institution in the United States. Among white women, there are 138 abortions for every 1000 live births; among blacks, there are 501 abortions for every 1000 births. This means that blacks are aborted at 3.6 times the rate of whites.

In his statement Thursday, Bishop Fabre commented on the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.’s historic “I Have A Dream” speech, whose 57th anniversary falls on Friday, August 28.

“On this Friday’s anniversary, in the midst of our country’s ongoing racial unrest, we restate our commitment to peacefully seeking racial justice,” the bishop said.

He also proposed that people of faith engage in prayer and fasting to end the violence as well as racial injustice.

“Considering the violence in Kenosha, Wisconsin, and in other cities across the nation, we urge all people of faith to observe August 28 or the Feast of St. Peter Claver on September 9 as a day of fasting and prayer,” he said.

“We must continue to engage the battle against the current evils of our society and in the words of Dr. King, refuse to believe ‘that the bank of justice is bankrupt,’” he said. “Dr. King’s dream, as he himself said, is deeply rooted in the American Dream. Let us not forget the price that he and so many courageous witnesses of all faiths and creeds paid to bring us to this moment.”

They need to ask how they managed to find themselves on the wrong side of the anthem and the flag; why they bowed to the mob against ordinary citizens and the police; and what possessed them to curse the very country they were attempting to lead.

The far-left forces that have taken over the Democratic Party are not just bad for its political fortunes. They are terrible for the country.

If a party takes power after encouraging, and participating in, violent protests, it will legitimize the future use of political violence. If a party takes power after attempting, through illegal means, to spy on the opposition and deny it the legitimate right to govern, it will subvert the very idea of democracy. If a party takes power after silencing free speech, with thugs demanding obedience in the street, it will never be able to restore the basic order that makes ordinary life possible.

Democrats need to confront the far-left. It will take more than one election. The Bernie Sanders wing of the party will claim that Democrats lost because they went with an establishment candidate — again — and subverted the progressive grass roots.

They will demand the chance to run one of their own — perhaps “Squad” leader Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez herself, who will turn 35 years old just before the next election. She has the charisma to win in 2024, depending on who Republicans choose.

Only once the very best of the “progressives” is defeated will Democrats begin to contemplate what went wrong.

It will not happen right away. The left has taken over the major cultural institutions — the schools, the universities, the media, even the sports world — and they will continue to push for revolution. Dissent within the party will still be dangerous. But over time, new leaders will find room to emerge.

Democrats will be liberated by their own defeat. Voters need to make sure it happens.

John Barrasso (R-WY) weighed in on the protests outside the White House following the completion of the Republican National Convention a night earlier.

Barrasso’s assessment, particularly as his colleague Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) and his wife were harassed by those protesters, that the Democratic Party has “surrendered to the mob.”

“I’m glad Rand and Kelley are fine,” he said. “I’ve seen the video, and I’m very grateful that the police were there to protect him from the mob. But remember, the Democrats have surrendered to the mob. We saw that last week at the Democrat Convention with the riding and the looting and the violence going on. Joe Biden said nothing about it. Kamala Harris said nothing about it. None of the speakers talked about it. We need to be defending the police, not defunding the police.”

“I think President Trump was right on last night,” Barrasso continued. “He had a strong message of law and order. We know that if Joe Biden is elected president, that they will slash funding for law enforcement in America. And for all of our families, whether a senator or a citizen, all across the country, we will all be a lot less safe.

Over four nights, we saw speaker after speaker telling the stories of African Americans, of immigrants, of women — and of how President Trump had fought for them all.

The convention explained conservative policies, but did so through personal testimonials — the grief of Ann Dorn and Kayla Mueller’s parents; the warnings of Maximo Alvarez; a young Madison Cawthorn rising to his feet.

There has been much hand-wringing in the media about how Trump has changed the GOP. For four days, Republicans celebrated civil rights leaders, suffragettes, and redeemed prisoners. If this is Trump’s “new” GOP, it is long overdue.

The feeling of a typical Republican voter, watching all of this, was one of pride — pride in the party, pride in the president, pride in the country.

For once, the Republican Party did not portray itself as part of a counterculture, pushing back against dominant liberal themes. Instead, the RNC took the best of those themes — diversity, tolerance, compassion — and told the Republican story in those terms.

Before the RNC, there was much talk about “shy” Trump voters. Fewer will be shy now.

But the RNC did more than simply present the case for one side of the political argument. It also told Americans a story about themselves — a story about a strong country, a country with much to celebrate, even during what Joe Biden and the Democrats called a “season of darkness.”

The fireworks display at the Washington Monument, and the opera at the White House, were audacious — and joyous. Democrats groused about the Hatch Act as the country sang along to patriotic songs.

America has not felt this way since the 1980s, since Ronald Reagan rescued the country from Jimmy Carter’s “malaise.”

Trump and the Republicans didn’t just appeal to an existing sense of patriotism; they helped us discover it again.

Sharpton believes this is dangerous because a “bunch of cult worshippers,” are in charge of the government.

Sharpton said, “I think this week showed that the Republican Party as we’ve known it, whether we’ve been part of it or those opposed to it, has gone from a political party to a cult of personality. We no longer have a Republican platform or party policies. We no longer have a set of ideas and a set of policies that they want to enact. We are guided by a personality who has made a bunch of cult worshippers, the party leaders, and the members of the cabinet. The danger is they are in charge of the government. To see one of the two major parties in this country reduced to a cult around a person who changes their mind and their stories any moment is at really, really levels of high danger.”

“I was once told that the only way I would ever be reunited with my family would be as a corpse,” Johnson said. “But by the grace of God and the compassion of President Donald John Trump, I stand before you tonight, and I assure you, I’m not a ghost. I am alive, I am well, and most importantly, I am free.”

Johnson also told Breitbart News that she hoped her remarks at the convention would share the story of how important giving people second chances are.

“I am honored to share my story at the president’s convention,” Johnson told Breitbart News. “For those who will be listening, I hope my story reminds us all that true justice must honor and provide mercy for those caught up in the system who deserve a chance at redemption, just like the president provided for me.”

“I told those men and women I left behind that I would be their voice and fight for them, whenever and wherever. And there are a lot of deserving people still in prison. I am grateful to the president for giving me a second chance at life and allowing me to share my story and mission on this stage.”

Johnson, who is now working as a criminal reform advocate, shared her story in her remarks.

“Some say, ‘You do the crime. You do the time,’” Johnson said. “However, that time should be fair and just. We’ve all made mistakes. None of us want to be defined forever based on our worst decision.”

“While in prison, I became a playwright, a mentor, a certified hospice volunteer, an ordained minister, and received the Special Olympics Event Coordinator of the Year award for my work with disabled women,” Johnson said. “Because the only thing worse than unjustly imprisoning my body, is trying to imprison my mind.”

“My transformation was described as ‘extraordinary,’” Johnson said. “Truth is, there are thousands of people just like me, who deserve the opportunity to come home.”

Johnson praised Trump not only for pardoning her but for getting legislation passed to help others.

“Six months after President Trump granted me a second chance, he signed the First Step Act into law. It was real justice reform,” Johnson said. “And it brought joy, hope, and freedom to thousands of well-deserving people.”

“The nearly 22 years I spent in prison were not wasted. God had a purpose and plan for my life,” Johnson said. “I was not delayed or denied; I was destined for such a time as this.”

The same is true of 10.5 percent of Independents but only 5.4 percent of Democrats.

According to this study, the “missing” or “shy” or “undercounted” Trump voter many suspect is downplaying the public’s true level of support for the president, is real.

In other words, Trump’s numbers, where he always seems to be trailing Rapey Joe Biden, do not reflect reality.

The study, conducted by CloudResearch out of New York, offers this bottom line regardless of whether you are Democrat, Republican, or an Independent: “10.1% of Trump supporters said they were likely to be untruthful on telephone surveys.”

Only 5.1 percent of Biden voters say the same.

CloudResearch didn’t just come out and ask people if they would lie. Instead, a number of steps were taken for the sake of accuracy.

Participants were first asked about their political preference. Then they were asked about how comfortable they were expressing a true opinion to a phone pollster. Later on, they were asked who they truly supported for president.

When asked why they would lie to a pollster, participants offered up a variety of answers, none all that surprising.

Some said they did not believe their preference would be kept confidential and feel it’s dangerous in this current climate to share an opinion that is not the accepted “liberal viewpoint.”

In a similar vein, others said they feared reprisal for their choice or that the call was being recorded. Some said they were ashamed of holding an opinion that is “frowned upon.”

Some answers had nothing at all to do with the politics or blacklisting. People are just sick of phone solicitations or fear that cooperation with this call will result in even more calls.

CloudResearch broke it down this way:

A lack of trust in phone polls as truly being anonymous. An apprehension to associate their phone numbers with recorded responses. Fear that their responses will become public in some manner. Fear of reprisal and related detrimental impact to their financial, social, and family lives should their political opinions become publicly known. A general dislike of phone polls. Malicious intent to mislead polls due to general distrust of media and political pundits (though a sentiment expressed only by a few “shy voters”).

As you can see, three of the six involve people worried about a climate where holding an opinion unapproved by the left — which of course includes the establishment media — will result in some kind of reprisal, or social penalty; the canceling and blacklisting that’s spread like a cancer among the left.

The fact that only a few “shy voters” said they misled pollsters (and by extension the media) due to their own “malicious intent” (number six) surprised me. During the 2016 election, when I still had a land line out here in the swing state of North Carolina, I was bombarded with pollster calls and out of my own “malicious intent” lied to every one of them for spite’s sake. I always identified as a 19-year-old black, female college student “Very Eager” to vote for Jill Stein.

This is nothing new for me. My online poker avatar is a middle-aged black woman named Petula.

Despite my own history of malicious intent, I’m still surprised by the results. As recently as last week, I laid out why I didn’t believe in the “shy Trump voter” theory while appearing as a guest on Dennis Miller’s podcast. Miller did a pretty good job convincing me otherwise, but I’m still surprised.

Nevertheless, the study is convincing. If the study had asked only if you are willing to a pollster, that wouldn’t convince me. My guess is that people are more likely to say they would lie to a pollster than are actually willing to lie to a pollster — if that makes sense. The way CloudResearch went about it, though, is probably the smartest way possible. They also took their time, sampling 1,000 registered voters online for more than a week, between August 19 and 27.

We’ll know soon enough.

McCarthy contemplated a situation in which the Republicans controlled the House, Senate and the White House.

“Think about how much more we could do if this president had a Congress and a Senate that would work for them,” he said. “That’s why we could actually retire Nancy Pelosi if people would go to takethehouse.com because it’s more than just the presidency. This is the nation and the next century. Is it going to be America’s? Are we going to guarantee that tomorrow will be better than today? Because what I watched for the four days of the Democrats and four days of the Republicans, it’s not hard to make a decision now. And it’s not hard to go out and make the case.”

“It doesn’t matter if you’re Republican, independent or Democrat, it’s a clear choice here,” McCarthy continued. “Joe Biden is not the same as he was before. Barack Obama has even said that there’s no difference between Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders. Bernie Sanders is a registered socialist. So either we’re going to go forward in prosperity, or we’re going to go backwards in poverty. We’re either going to go forward in freedom or backward in socialism. It’s a very clear choice.”

Later in the segment, McCarthy reacted to Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden’s apparent pivot on addressing the unrest, say it was “too late.”

“There’s two things he did not talk about in his speech,” McCarthy said. “He did not talk about what was going on in this country right then, day in and day out in Portland. He — he would not talk about the unrest in America because he supported it. You know, 13 people on his campaign actually gave money to bail people out who were looting and beating people up. So he must support that.”

“He has actually said he would defund the police,” he added. “He says I didn’t use the word. No, he wants to reallocate the money. That’s defunding the police. It’s too late for Joe Biden to stand up to what has been going on day in and day out. And the part that I see is when we look at what happened in Wisconsin, President Trump leaned in and was going to help the National Guard to be able to get there. The governor of Wisconsin said, no, and only brought 250 troops when they were asking for 750 to 1,500.”

Fox 13 reports the incident occurred around 6:10 a.m., when the suspect tried to board a school bus as it stopped to pick up a child for school.

Sheriff Judd said, “[The driver] had stopped, picked up a child, when this guy tried to get in the school bus. That school bus driver is a hero. She kept the doors locked. She didn’t let him in when he tried to get in. God bless our school bus drivers.”

Judd said the man pivoted from trying to board the bus and targeted a house instead, “[bursting] through the front glass door.”

Once in the house Judd said the man was “wild and out-of-control.”

A father was home with his nine-year-old child at the time. The man allegedly began throwing shattered glass at the father and the father shot him, fatally wounding the man.

Sheriff Judd used a Polk County Sheriff’s Office Facebook post to explain the man jumped onto numerous vehicles “butt first” as he ran from the bus toward the house he targeted. An occupant in one of the vehicles described the man as “growling.”

Chris Coons (D-DE), a supporter of Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, about how the Biden’s campaign has handled the civil unrest in cities throughout America.

Coons insisted Biden had been an opponent of rioting and looting. However, MacCallum pointed out that it did not get a mention during the Democratic debate.

Partial transcript as follows:

MACCALLUM: So let’s bring in Democrat Senator Chris Coons, also advocate for Joe Biden. Senator, always good to have you with us. Thanks for being here tonight.

SEN. CHRIS COONS (D-DE): Thanks, Martha. Great to be with you this evening.

MACCALLUM: So I hope you heard the introduction. There was a woman who called into CSPAN, which was a Democrat voter from Minneapolis. She said that she was very upset. She almost sounded like she had tears in her voice when she spoke, that the Democrats at the convention did not talk about what’s happening in her city.

And we’ve seen a pretty major pivot over the past 24 hours to Joe Biden starting to bring it up and others starting to bring it up as well so what’s going on here?

COONS: Well, Martha, here’s what I heard in the last few minutes in Mark Meadows interview and earlier today from Joe Biden. The Chief of Staff to President Trump just said something that is flat out demonstrably untrue, and Joe Biden spoke to it earlier today.

Former Vice President Biden is clear both that he finds these incidents, like the attack on Jacob Blake, like the brutal murder of George Floyd absolutely unacceptable. He thinks these are horrible. They should not happen in the United States, and he’s denounced them and has called for a full and thorough and prompt investigation.

And he joins the family of Jacob Blake in rejecting violence in saying that protesters who are peaceful and orderly, that’s terrific. That is an appropriate way in the United States to express your concerns, but when it becomes a riot, when there’s violence, when there’s looting, that violates our laws, and Joe Biden, and Kamala Harris do not support that.

MACCALLUM: Well, to be honest with you Senator, that’s exactly –

COONS: Well, we just heard Mark Meadows say that –

MACCALLUM: Say that what?

COONS: We just heard Mark Meadows say a completely untrue thing about Joe Biden’s record and where he currently stands so I appreciate the chance to be on here and to help correct that record.

MACCALLUM: Yes but everything that you just said about the concerns over the shooting of Jacob Blake and the killing of George Floyd, every American shares that feeling and every American, I think –

COONS: Well, I’m not sure we’re going to hear that from President Trump tonight, are we, Martha? Martha, are we going to hear from President Trump tonight that he has a plan, both for how we’re going to heal the racial divides in our country and for how we’re going to recover from this pandemic.

I’ll remind you the United States has 5 million infected Americans. They have –

MACCALLUM: We’ll come to COVID, but I want to understand this topic for just a moment if I may Senator, that the fact of the matter is I covered almost every minute of the Democratic Convention. There was no discussion about the violence is happening in our cities, and that’s what you heard from that Democrat voter.

She said I’ve changed my mind. I can’t believe that no one is talking about what’s happening. The looting, the rioting. Every time I brought up the question about what’s happening in the cities, I was told it’s not a big deal. And you know, that it’s mostly peaceful protests.

We don’t have mostly peaceful protests with huge fires burning in the back of them, and now suddenly there’s a recognition on the part of Joe Biden, and I think that’s great. I think everybody says yes, it is time to recognize the pain of these people who have their buildings and their businesses destroyed, Sir.

COONS: Martha, it’s not sudden. This is something that Joe Biden has a long record on — supporting appropriate community policing. We’re being presented with a false choice here. In the United States, we should expect justice for all Americans. We should expect to live in a country where we both uphold the rule of law, where we support law enforcement, where we expect folks to conduct themselves in peaceful and lawful ways.

And where it’s unacceptable, it’s not necessary to our safety and security that police occasionally conduct themselves in unlawful ways so it’s the family of Jacob Blake that is joining former Vice President Biden in calling for calm and peace in Kenosha.

MACCALLUM: Absolutely, we heard that from Mrs. Jackson.

COONS: It is important that the American people know that Joe Biden has a long and clear and positive record of both fighting for racial injustice.

MACCALLUM: So if you – honestly, if you can find me an instance where he condemned the violence and the looting and the rioting during the Democratic Convention, I would love for you to send it to me because if it exists, I will be the first one to admit that he spoke about it at that convention, but I did not see or hear him say that, but please let me know if you did.

COONS: Martha, please play his statement from today.

MACCALLUM: No, that’s different. I told you, I earlier, I said that the tone is changed in the last 24 hours. I absolutely heard what he said today, so I’m glad I think most people are glad that there’s a recognition. I know that woman voter for Minneapolis is glad that now that’s being recognized on both sides of the aisle as well.

I want to ask about the debates. What do you think Nancy Pelosi was suggesting today when she said that she thought that there shouldn’t be any debates and that if she were advising Joe Biden, she would tell him not to debate President Trump. Are you OK with that?

COONS: Well, here’s what I know is true. Joe Biden has accepted the three debates. Donald Trump has not. Joe Biden is eager to debate Donald Trump about his record, and I hope that tonight the American people instead of just a long string of attacks on Joe Biden, some of them untrue, we’ll hear a positive plan from President Trump about how he’s going to deal with both the pandemic and racial inequality.

Nancy Pelosi is the Speaker of the House. She’s negotiating with Mark Meadows. I appreciate her advice, but former Vice President Joe Biden has already committed to three debates with Donald Trump. Donald Trump, our president, has not.

MACCALLUM: Well, the last I heard he was pushing for a fourth debate and I think the consortium is also interested in that and they’re waiting to hear a response from the Biden campaign because in 22 days people start voting and I think both sides feel that it would be helpful if the people who start voting in 22 days have already seen at least one of these debates.

So do you believe there should be a debate prior to the beginning of voting, so a fourth debate?

COONS: There absolutely should be debates between Donald Trump and Joe Biden. The argument in the Supreme Court of the United States in which President Trump, his allies and supporters in a dozen states are going to try to repeal, what is left of the Affordable Care Act of protection for 130 million Americans with pre-existing conditions, that argument happens the week after the election.

President Trump has talked out of both sides of his mouth about healthcare. He promised in 2016 that he would replace the Affordable Care Act with something that costs less and protect more. Instead, we’ve got a system where he is still trying to take away healthcare for more than 100 million Americans.

I think he should present in dignity his defense for that course of action.

MACCALLUM: Absolutely, and I would love to ask him that question in a debate as well. I think it’s a great question and both sides should be asked about what they’re going to do about healthcare and everything else. Senator Coons, thank you very much. It’s always good to speak with you, Sir. Thank you for coming tonight.","FNC’s MacCallum to Chris Coons: ‘We’ve Seen a Pretty Major Pivot over the Past 24 Hours’ from Biden on Looting, Rioting",fake

He announced on Friday that he will resign due to health concerns, capping a remarkable career that left three of his greatest ambitions unfulfilled: Revising the Japanese constitution to allow more initiative in national defense, returning Japanese citizens kidnapped by North Korea, and officially wrapping up World War II by securing a peace treaty with Russia.

Abe’s career might not be completely over, since he said on Friday that he feels his struggle with ulcerative colitis made it necessary for him to resign as prime minister a year before he was scheduled to leave the office, but he plans to run for a seat in the Japanese parliament next year.

Nicknamed “The Prince” because he comes from a political dynasty that includes former foreign and prime ministers, Abe graduated from Seikei University in 1977 and worked for Kobe Steel, Japan’s top steel manufacturer, until he entered the political arena as an assistant to the minister of foreign affairs in 1982.

Abe won his first elected office as a legislator from Yamaguchi prefecture in 1993 and held a number of positions within the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). He joined the administration of Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi as chief cabinet secretary in 2005.

Abe became the 21st president of the LDP, and the 90th prime minister of Japan, in September 2006 and resigned exactly one year later, after his party suffered huge losses in legislative elections and Abe suffered increasing complications from inflammatory bowel disease, an ailment he said he has struggled with since high school.

Abe has said that only the advent of new medicines in 2009 allowed him to restore his health and return to politics. He became prime minister again in 2012 at the head of a resurgent LDP and has held the office ever since. The LDP changed its rules in 2017 to let him serve a third term as its president, and therefore remain prime minister, and it was ready to change them again so he could serve a fourth term, but Abe ruled that out in March 2019 and said he would leave office in 2021.

Abe’s return to the top office was followed by the launch of “Abenomics,” his ambitious program to increase Japan’s gross domestic product while restraining inflation. Abe described his program as “three arrows” in a quiver: fiscal stimulus, monetary policy, and structural reforms, including corporate tax cuts, regulatory relief, and a much-touted plan to bring more Japanese women into the workforce.

The reform arrow was arguably the one that hit its target closest to the bullseye. The rest of the Abenomics platform produced mixed results until recently, when it seemed the Japanese economy was finally starting to take off and then the coronavirus struck.

Like most non-dictatorial world leaders, Abe got mixed reviews for his handling of the coronavirus pandemic, including some jeers for encouraging tourism in a time of disease panic and distributing inadequate protective face masks that were nicknamed “Abenomasks.” His approval ratings currently stand at their lowest point during his eight-year term, largely due to the coronavirus and a faltering economy.

In the foreign policy arena, Abe was most renowned, and sometimes most reviled, for his hawkish stance on national defense and his desire to amend the pacifist constitution. Abe argued that Japan should be able to act in “collective defense” with Japan’s allies to neutralize threats beyond the country’s borders, including terrorists, the psychotic dictatorship in North Korea, and perhaps an increasingly aggressive China.

Pacifism has become very deeply ingrained in Japanese society since World War II, so the changes Abe wished to make were highly controversial. There were fistfights over pacifism in parliament. Prime Minister Abe never got the changes he wanted.

Abe found himself embroiled in a bitter dispute with South Korea over the lingering issues of conscripted labor and South Korean “comfort women” abused by Imperial Japan during its occupation, and he was unable to settle Japan’s other unfinished World War II business with Russia, which revolves around an intractable territorial dispute.

On the domestic front, Abe struggled with corruption and influence scandals, particularly a controversial land deal involving his wife that prompted his old mentor, former Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi, to call for Abe’s resignation in April. Just when Abe thought he might have put the long-simmering controversy behind him, a former government official brought it back into the headlines by committing suicide. Even the company that gave Abe his big break in business, Kobe Steel, ended up in a controversy during his term, raising criticism that the LDP and Abenomics have been too indulgent to large, well-connected firms.

Abe was credited with raising Japan’s profile on the world stage, developing strong trading relationships with other Pacific Rim nations, significantly upgrading Japan’s defenses even though he never got the constitutional amendments he wanted, and improving Japan’s relationship with China.

He became one of the closest world leaders to U.S. President Donald Trump, nominating Trump for a Nobel Peace Prize in 2019. It can be difficult to judge such things among the pressure and illusions of global statecraft, but Trump and Abe seem to genuinely enjoy each other’s company. Under the previous U.S. administration, Abe was credited with arranging President Barack Obama’s visit to Hiroshima, the first time a sitting U.S. president paid a visit to the city destroyed by a nuclear bomb in World War II.

Abe is generally lauded for bringing stability to Japan, both in domestic politics and international relations. His long tenure as prime minister came after a string of predecessors who rarely lasted more than a year. He was able to bring the economy out of a recession, even if the subsequent performance of Abenomics was often disappointing, and Abe may yet have the last word on economic reform, since the coronavirus is prodding many other nations to adopt platforms similar to his. With the obvious exception of South Korea, he generally did a good job of strengthening Japan’s crucial alliances and trade partnerships.

His departure may bring a period of unwelcome political instability as successors jockey for position. Abe declined to endorse anyone to replace him, although the inside word is that he favors his party policy chief, Fumio Kishida.

The LDP looks to remain dominant against a divided opposition. The top advisers and close allies who would normally be logical choices to take up his mantle, like Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga and Deputy Prime Minister/Finance Minister Taro Aso, have suffered from declining approval ratings as Abe himself became unpopular. Kishida might prove to be a tough sell to Japanese voters because he is associated with the lackluster coronavirus response. Waiting in the wings is former LDP chief Shigeru Ishiba, an old adversary of Abe’s who has been building support from both the public and LDP lawmakers. A power struggle appears likely, bringing Abe Shinzo’s eight years of stability to an end.",Abe Shinzo Retires After Eventful Career as Japan’s Longest-Serving PM,fake

The Chinese Foreign Ministry also weighed in the speech, delivered Thursday night in front of the White House, asking candidates “not to make an issue out of China in its election.”

Trump’s policies towards China — meant to curb increased economic dependence on the country and combat widespread cyber-crime, intellectual property theft, and espionage by dictator Xi Jinping’s state — are a primary selling point of his re-election campaign. During his speech Thursday, Trump vowed to “also provide tax credits to bring jobs out of China back to America, and we will impose tariffs on any company that leaves America to produce jobs overseas.”

“We’ll make sure our companies and jobs stay in our country, as I’ve already been doing. Joe Biden’s agenda is Made in China. My agenda is Made in the USA,” Trump said.

The Global Times accused him of “shifting blame” away from himself towards China on several issues, including the economy and the Chinese coronavirus pandemic, made possible by the Communist Party’s woeful handling of the initial outbreak of the newly discovered pathogen in central Wuhan city. One study found the Communist Party could have prevented up to 95 percent of cases of the virus within its borders if it had not actively suppressed public health information on curtailing the spread of disease.

“Touting a twisted reality with rhetoric about his personal achievements, President Donald Trump delivered his GOP nomination speech to run for a second term on Thursday local time,” the Global Times claimed. “Trump mentioned China more than 10 times, including calling COVID-19 [the Chinese coronavirus] the ‘China virus,’ touting his efforts to contain China and claiming China wants Biden to win. In comparison, Biden only mentioned China once in his speech last week.”

The Chinese state propaganda outlet interpreted this as favorable to Biden. It then relayed that its “experts” — Communist Party approved talking heads — had dismissed Trump’s references to his policy on China as “a timeworn tactic that Trump also used four years ago in his first election campaign; in fact, antagonizing China is his way of creating an enemy in an attempt to appease his base.”

The Times concluded by accusing the United States under Trump of “moving backwards on human rights.”

In a more official capacity, China’s Foreign Ministry also responded to Trump’s speech on Friday. Zhao Lijian, the spokesman responsible for the conspiracy theory that the Chinese coronavirus originated in a U.S. Army laboratory, urged both Trump and Biden “not to make an issue out of China in its election.”

“Regarding what he said about China, I’d like to reiterate China’s consistent and clear policy towards the U.S. We believe both stand to gain from cooperation and lose from confrontation,” Zhao claimed. “We urge the U.S. to look at China and bilateral relations in an objective and rational light, work with us towards the same goal, manage differences, promote cooperation and bring China-US relations back onto the right track of coordination, cooperation and stability.”

Zhao also called any criticism of the negative effects of globalism on local communities “perverse.”

He previously weighed in on the RNC on Thursday, disparaging a speech by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.

“Every time Pompeo opens his mouth, the international community sees with greater clarity who is peddling lies, disinformation and Cold-War mentality and who is upholding world peace, global development and international order,” Zhao told reporters. “Every time Pompeo opens his mouth, the Chinese people support the Communist Party of China more and love the motherland more.”

Chinese state media has spent much of the week disparaging the programming at the RNC. On Thursday, the Global Times called the United States in its entirety “paranoid” and contended that Trump’s policies were necessary to scam “groups with very poor education, especially whites without a university degree.”

“To have a clear picture of the real distribution of economic and trade benefits between China and the US requires a sharper set of academic skills than they have,” the Times claimed.

In another article on Thursday, the outlet cited its “experts” once again to decry that Trump had turned the Republican Party into a “street gang.” Its evidence of this was the appearance of Chinese dissident Chen Guangcheng — a blind self-taught lawyer who fought against forced abortions and other abuses of women in his rural village — at the RNC.

“The [Republican] party could not find any more decent people to give a speech, nor could it find any new topic. Chen has been wandering in the US for almost 10 years since he arrived in the country in 2012,” an “expert” identified as Fudan University professor Shen Yi said.

The Global Times also accused the RNC of “xenophobia,” failing to mention that Trump presided over a live naturalization ceremony to welcome five new Americans to the country.

The Great Andamanese count only 53 surviving members, meaning the positive virus cases pose a serious threat to the ancient tribe’s survival.

The Great Andamanese are one of six indigenous tribes that have inhabited the Andaman Islands in the northeastern Indian Ocean for thousands of years. The archipelago is located in the Bay of Bengal roughly 80 miles southwest of the coast of Myanmar, which rules over some of the islands. Most of the islands comprise the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, which India governs as federal territory.

For several weeks, Dr. Avijit Roy has led India’s effort to contain the Andaman Islands’ coronavirus outbreak. He says his team traveled to a remote island inhabited by most of the Great Andamanese to test all members there for coronavirus last week. Four of the tribe members tested positive for coronavirus, Dr. Roy told the BBC on Thursday.

“They have been moved to [a] hospital,” he said. Indian health officials suspect the men may have traveled from the remote islet to the main Andaman Islands where they likely caught the virus.

Six other Great Andaman tribe members who lived in Port Blair, the capital city of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, tested positive for the coronavirus a month ago, according to Dr. Roy. All six have since recovered.

The doctor said his team was now monitoring other indigenous tribes on the islands for further spread of the virus.

“We are keeping a close watch on movements and mass testing some of the [other Andaman] tribes,” Dr. Roy said.

The Andaman and Nicobar Islands have recorded 2,985 infections and 41 deaths from the Chinese coronavirus since first detecting the virus’s presence on the archipelago in early June, according to the report.

India, the world’s second-most populous country, “has posted the highest single-day caseload in the world every day since August 7,” Reuters reported on Thursday, citing official health data. On Thursday, India reported 75,760 new coronavirus cases, its “highest single-day spike yet,” according to Business Insider India.",Remote Indian Ocean Tribe Tests Positive for Coronavirus,fake

Police have declared the deaths suicides, but opposition supporters say they suspect foul play on the part of Belarus security forces.

For the past two and a half weeks, tens of thousands of demonstrators have taken to the streets in the country to protest the results of the nation’s August 9 presidential election, which saw Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko elected to a sixth consecutive term. Dissidents immediately rejected the vote as rigged by the state election commission. Their ongoing protests against the election results have since evolved into a general demand for Lukashenko, Belarus’s first and only president for the past 26 years, to step down.

Nikita Krivtsov, 28, went missing on August 12 after participating in the protests. His body was found ten days later on August 22 “in a wooded area outside Minsk, hanging from a tree,” CBS News reported Wednesday. “Police said there was no evidence of foul play, indicating it was a suicide.”

Krivtsov was buried on Tuesday in his hometown of Maladzyechna in northwestern Belarus. The city is located about 45 miles outside of the capital, Minsk, which has been the epicenter of the ongoing anti-government protests. At Tuesday’s funeral, friends and relatives of the man “blamed the police for killing him, calling it an act of reprisal for [Nikita] daring to stand up to the government,” according to the report.

“I’m 100 percent certain that he died at the hands of police,” Alexander Novik, a friend of Krivtsov’s, told CBS News. “If they can do it to him, I fear they can do it to anyone,” he added.

The man’s widow, Elena Krivtsova, told the Associated Press (AP) this week that she has submitted a formal request to the nation’s top investigative agency, the Belarus Investigative Committee, to launch a criminal inquiry into Nikita’s death.

“I don’t believe that Nikita could have done it himself,” Elena told the AP. “He was a cheerful and positive man, he liked his daughter very much, had a good job and a decent salary. He never expressed any thoughts about suicide.”

On August 18, the body of another Belarus dissident, Konstantin Shishmakov, “was found hanged in a forest in western Belarus,” according to AP. “Shishmakov, who headed a small military history museum in Volkovysk near the Polish border, was a member of an election commission who spoke against alleged falsifications in the August 9 balloting. Local police said they found no evidence of a crime, but the death has raised opposition suspicions of foul play.”",Report: Two Belarus Protesters Found Hanging from Trees,fake

The animation depicts the Washington Monument crumbling, the Capitol Building being destroyed in an explosion, and an American flag being riddled with bullets as the narrator exhorts “Death to America” as is the custom with propaganda eminating from the Islamic republic.

The spoken word poem titled “People Everywhere Are Chanting ‘Death to America'” was uploaded to the Islamic Pulse YouTube channel, which is based in Qom, Iran. It was re-released and translated by the Middle East Media and Research Institute (MEMRI).

The animation ends with the Washington Monument crumbling, the Capitol Building being destroyed in an explosion, and an American flag being riddled with bullets. It ends with this spoken warning and clarification on the words “Death to America”:

This statement was never about hatred towards people of America, it was a statement of warning to the people of America that this capitalistic, militarized, racist, barbaric, satanic system called America was dangerous. We the people of the world had bared the brunt of it already. The solution to our problems and the solution to your problems lies in the removal of this entire institution called America. The day it greets its last will be the day the world will breathe again.

Crying “Death to America” is a common pastime in Iran, used as a formal greeting and religious habit wherever observant Muslims gather. It is also shouted as an opener or closer to large public gatherings.

As Breitbart News reported, last year Iranians who gathered in Islam’s holy city of Mecca in Saudi Arabia for the annual hajj pilgrimage called for both Israel’s destruction while also chanting “Death to America.”

At a “disavowal of polytheists” ceremony in Mecca, the reading of a message from Iran’s Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei reportedly prompted a crowd of Iranian hajj pilgrims to chant in furious response, “Death to America! Death to Israel! … America is the enemy of Allah! Israel is the enemy of Allah [and] should be erased from the face of the Earth!”

In April last year, Iranian lawmakers opened a new session of the country’s Parliament with chants of “Death to America.”

The taunt was meant as a response to the White House’s designation of Iran’s elite paramilitary Islamic Revolution Guard Corps (IRGC) a foreign terrorist organization.

More recently a senior Muslim cleric in the Iranian city of Yasoujhas sought to reassure U.S. citizens that when Iranians chant bloodcurdling threats of “Death to America” it does not mean death to all the American people – just some.

He said it means death to American leaders past and present – including Presidents Trump, Obama, George W. Bush and George H.W. Bush – so normal citizens should not be afraid of Iran’s bloody vengeance.

There were no immediate reports of casualties or major damage on either side.

Israel and Hamas have traded fire on a number of occasions in recent weeks, and Hamas has launched a wave of incendiary balloons across the frontier that have torched wide swathes of farmland.

Hamas is pressing Israel to ease its blockade on Gaza and allow large-scale development projects. Egypt and Qatar are trying to shore up an informal cease-fire.

Those efforts have grown more urgent in recent days as authorities in Gaza have detected the first cases of local transmission of the coronavirus. Hamas has imposed a lockdown in the coastal territory bordering Israel and Egypt, which is home to 2 million Palestinians.

Bassem Naim, a Hamas official, warned of further escalation, saying the “catastrophic conditions the Gaza Strip is experiencing are unprecedented.” He said the situation could lead to an “explosion in which things get out of control.”

Israel and Egypt imposed a blockade on Gaza after Hamas seized power from rival Palestinian forces in 2007. Israel says the blockade is needed to keep Hamas from expanding its arsenal, but critics view it as a form of collective punishment.

The latest massacre resulted in the discovery of three young men on the road outside the city of Ocaña, located close to the country’s eastern border with Venezuela.

On Saturday, six people were also killed in Tumaco, a port city near the southern border with Ecuador; three people were shot dead near Medellín; and another three were murdered in the eastern region of Arauca.

The killings add up to seven massacres in the space of two weeks; there have been more than 46 massacres (defines as the murder of three or more people at once) so far this year.

Among those most severely affected by the violence have been human rights activists and community leaders, more than 100 of whom have been murdered so far this year. The pandemic has also led to armed groups (including drug cartels, Marxist guerillas, and alleged right-wing paramilitaries) exerting greater control over nearby territory, with at least 30 people murdered simply for breaking quarantine rules.

Addressing supporters this weekend in the department of Nariño, President Iván Duque attempted to play down the use of the term “massacres,” instead describing them as “collective homicides.”

“Many people have said: ‘the massacres returned, the massacres returned,'” he explained. “First let’s talk about the precise name: ‘collective homicides’, and sadly we must accept it as a country, it is not that they returned, it is that these events of ‘collective homicides’ have not sadly gone away.”

Such figures continue to undermine the alleged success of the government’s 2016 peace deal with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), which was supposed to bring an end to the decades-long war between the state and the Marxist terror group and usher in a new area of peace in a country so long plagued by violence.

The 2016 deal, which gave amnesty to FARC leaders and guaranteed them uncontested seats as lawmakers, was forced through the Colombian Congress by former President Juan Manuel Santos despite its rejection in a nationwide plebiscite. The Colombian constitution requires a national vote to approve such a move, rendering the peace deal unconstitutional. Santos nonetheless won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2016.

FARC has repeatedly violated the terms set out in the agreement, while many of its militants have defected to other far-left terrorist groups such as the People’s Liberation Army (ELN), which has carried out multiple terrorist attacks over the past four years. Duque, who took office in 2018, has since set about unraveling parts of the deal which were opposed by a majority of Colombians when the referendum was held.

“You’re going down, Trump. I’m taking you down. On your knees. On your knees,” the individual said as the performance continued.

“Only for a beautiful woman will I get down on my knee,” the man playing Trump said while holding a sign reading, “Presidency of the Absurd.”

“Black Lives Matter Trump. Take a knee,” the fake cop continued, encouraging everyone in the area to chant, “Trump take a knee.”

“Trump” dramatically struggled but eventually took a knee, to the victorious response of the group.

“Use your power. We are free. Use creative, honest, respectful — ingenuity,” the protester donning a pig nose added as the performance concluded.",Protesters in Pig Masks and Police Uniforms Force 'Trump' to Take a Knee,fake

According to video posted by the Daily Caller’s Shelby Talcott, protesters put a piece of paper on the Trump doll that said, “Ticket — Facist, Rapist, Criminal.”

In another video posted by RawsMedia, the Trump doll was seen tied up with a mask over its face.

The protests at the White House came on the last night of the Republican National Convention, as Trump delivered his speech on the White House South Lawn.

“We must never allow mob rule,” Trump said in his speech, condemning the violence and looting in recent weeks around the country in Democrat-run cities.

In another photo posted by Dinesh D’Souza, a paper sign that said “The Palm Collective,” could be seen posted on the guillotine.

The Palm Collective’s website said the organization’s mission is to “connect individuals, networks, and grassroots organizations together to end systemic racism in DC and beyond while creating powerful communities through the power of Collective Action. We are a Black-led organization and are proud to center the voices of our fellow BIPOC members.”

It is not clear if the Palm Collective is responsible for the guillotine display, or if a member of the group simply posted a flyer on the guillotine.

Protesters followed and heckled the elderly man and woman — who was wearing a “Trump 2020” t-shirt.

“Get the f**k out!” a protester shouted through a megaphone at the couple. “Why?” the man can be heard responding.

A female protester could be seen running at the man and pushing him. The man continued walking, as protesters continued to push him from behind.

He could be heard saying he was there to watch fireworks.

Fireworks were planned to be set off later that evening at the National Mall after President Trump accepted the Republican presidential nominee.

Protesters threw water on the man as he walked and then sucker-punched him, knocking him to the ground, according to videos posted by Daily Caller journalist Phillip Nieto and Townhall journalist Julio Rosas. According to Rosas, there was blood on his face.

11:35 PM: Trump says he is very proud to be the nominee of the Republican Party after promising to make America safer and stronger.

At the end of Pres Trump's 1 hr 10 min speech, fireworks were set off at the Washington Monument.. pic.twitter.com/EPRcUuPagz — Mark Knoller (@markknoller) August 28, 2020

11:30 PM: Trump says his “opponents believe that America is a depraved nation.”

“We want our sons and daughters to know the truth: America is the greatest and most exceptional nation in the history of the world,” he says. “Our country wasn’t built by cancel culture, speech codes, and soul-crushing conformity. We are not a nation of timid spirits. We are a nation of fierce, proud, and independent American patriots.”

Trump wants every child in America to know that they are part of the most exciting adventure in human history.

“No matter where your family comes from, no matter your background, in America, anyone can rise. With hard work, devotion, and drive, you can reach any goal and achieve every ambition,” he says.

11:25 PM: Trump vows to make America the manufacturing superpower of the world and end our reliance on China while not getting into endless wars. Trump vows to end sanctuary cities and win the race to 5G. He promises a more ambitious space program (He says America will land the first woman on the moon and will be the first nation to plant its flag on Mars.) in addition to missile defense. He also says if he doesn’t win, “your Second Amendment doesn’t have a chance.”

Trump also promises to “restore patriotic education to our schools” and always “protect free speech on college campuses.”

Trump says this is the unifying national agenda that will bring the country together.

11:22 PM: Trump says Biden is a “weak” candidate who “takes his marching orders from liberal hypocrites who drive their cities into the ground while fleeing far from the scene of the wreckage.” He says they want to prevent school choice while sending their kids to the best schools; want to open borders while living in gated communities; want to defund the police while having armed security details.

11:20 PM: Trump says we must also “reclaim our independence from the left’s repressive mandates. Americans are exhausted trying to keep up with the latest list of approved words and phrases, and the ever-more restrictive political decrees. Many things have a different name now, and the rules are constantly changing. The goal of cancel culture is to make decent Americans live in fear of being fired, expelled, shamed, humiliated, and driven from society as we know it. The far-left wants to coerce you into saying what you know to be false, and scare you out of saying what you know to be true.”

11:18 PM: Trump says if Democrats want to “to stand with anarchists, agitators, rioters, looters, and flag-burners, that is up to them.” But the Republican Party will remain the voice of the patriotic heroes who keep America safe and salute the American flag.”

Trump says Biden and Democrats ignore the thousands of African-Americans killed in cities run by Democrats, but he never will.

Trump says they are coming after him because he is fighting for you.

11:16 PM: Trump rips Biden for not mentioning the riots at the convention and says Democrats are now talking about it because their poll numbers are sinking like a rock in water. Trump says at least 13 members of the Biden campaign donated to bail out the rioters and looters.

Trump now tells the story of the late David Dorn, whose wife powerfully spoke earlier.

“We are honored to be joined tonight by his wife Ann and beloved family members: Brian and Kielen. To each of you: we will never forget the heroic legacy of Captain David Dorn,” Trump says. “Great man.”

11:15 PM: Trump says we can’t allow mob rule, and the GOP condemns the rioting in cities run by Democrats like Portland, Kenosha, Chicago, and New York.

Trump says when he signed an order for 10-year prison sentences for those tearing down monuments, they suddenly stopped.

11:10 PM: Trump warns if you give power to Biden, the radical left will defund police departments all over America. They will make every city look like Portland and “nobody will be safe in Biden’s America.” He says his administration will always stand with America’s law enforcement officers. Trump introduces the story of Detective Miosotis Familia of the NYPD. Three years ago, she was ambushed and murdered “by a monster who hated her purely for wearing the badge.”

“Detective Familia was a single mom. She’d recently asked for the night shift so she could spend more time with her kids. Two years ago, I stood in front of the U.S. Capitol alongside those children, and held their grandmother’s hand as they mourned their terrible loss and we honored Detective Familia’s extraordinary life.” Trump introduces her three children Genesis, Peter, and Delilah.

Trump says we must remember that the overwhelming majority of police officers are good and noble but they are afraid to do their jobs right now and thus are unable to protect the people they want to serve.

11:06 PM: After ripping Biden for wanting to give lawyers and health care to illegal immigrants, Trump says Biden also “supports deadly sanctuary cities that protect criminal aliens. He promised to end national security travel bans from Jihadist nations, and he pledged to increase refugee admissions by 700 percent. This is in the manifesto. The Biden Plan would eliminate America’s borders in the middle of a global pandemic.” He says Biden is even talking about “taking the wall down. How about that?”

Trump says “Biden claims he has empathy for the vulnerable, yet the party he leads supports the extreme late-term abortion of defenseless babies right up to the moment of birth. Democrat leaders talk about moral decency, but they have no problem with stopping a baby’s beating heart in the ninth month of pregnancy.” He says Democrats ” refuse to protect innocent life, and then they lecture us about morality and saving America’s soul….Tonight, we proudly declare that all children, born and unborn, have a God-given right to life.”

Trump says during the DNC, “under God” was removed from the Pledge of Allegiance twice.

11:05 PM: Trump says he will impose tariffs on any company that leaves America to produce jobs overseas. He says Biden’s agenda is “Made in China” while his agenda is “Made in the USA.”

“Biden has promised to abolish the production of American oil, coal, shale, and natural gas – laying waste to the economies of Pennsylvania, Ohio, Texas, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Colorado, and New Mexico,” Trump then says while talking about energy issues, blaming these policies for crippling power outages in California. He says how can Biden claim to be an ally of the light when his own party can’t even keep the lights on.

11:02 PM: Trump says that “instead of following the science, Joe Biden wants to inflict a painful shutdown on the entire country. His shutdown would inflict unthinkable and lasting harm on our nation’s children, families, and citizens of all backgrounds.”

“The cost of the Biden shutdown would be measured in increased drug overdoses, depression, alcohol addiction, suicides, heart attacks, economic devastation, job loss and much more. Joe Biden’s plan is not a solution to the virus, but rather it’s a surrender to the virus” he says.

Trump vows to “crush” the virus before saying while Biden claims to be an “ally of the light,” but when it comes to his agenda, he wants to keep us completely in the dark. He says Biden’s tax hikes will collapse the economy and the stock market.

10:50 PM: Trump says the Middle East was in chaos when he took office. He said he withdrew from the Iran Deal and, unlike previous presidents, kept his promise to move the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem. After talking about the first Middle East peace deal in 25 years and obliterating ISIS and killing al-Baghdadi and Iran’s Soleimani, Trump says unlike past administrations, he kept America out of wars (and rebuilding the military) and spent the last four years reversing the damage Biden did over the last 47 years. He says Biden supported NAFTA, supported China’s entry into the WTO, which led to America losing one-in-four manufacturing jobs. He says voters in the Rust Belt didn’t want to hear Biden’s hollow words of “empathy. They wanted their jobs back.” He says Biden opposed killing bin Laden and cheered China’s rise. He says “China would own our country” if Biden is elected. He says based on good information, China wants Biden to win.

10:49 PM: Trump says he has done more for the Black community than Joe Biden has done in 47 years and the best is yet to come.

10:45 PM: Trump talks about ending catch and release and deporting 20,000 gang members and 50,000 criminal aliens. He salutes Border Patrol officers in attendance. He talks about taking on Big Pharma and passing Right to Try in addition to VA accountability and VA choice. He talks about opportunity zones, criminal justice reform, and funding for HBCUs.

10:42 PM: Trump says Washington insiders have pleaded with him to let China steal our jobs and robbing us blind but, “We took the toughest, boldest, strongest, and hardest hitting action against China in American History.”

Trump said the establishment said it would be impossible to replace NAFTA, but they were wrong when he signed the USMCA trade deal into law.

10:40 PM: Trump says he has done nothing but fight for you since he left his former life.

“I did what our political establishment never expected and could never forgive, breaking the cardinal rule of Washington Politics. I kept my promises,” Trump says. Together, we have ended the rule of the failed political class – and they are desperate to get their power back by any means necessary. You’ve seen that. They are angry at me because instead of putting them first, I’ve simply put America first.”

10:38 PM: Trump says Biden took the donations of blue-collar workers for 47 years and gave them hugs and kisses, told them he felt their pain, and then flew back to Washington and shipped their jobs to China and to distant lands and outsourced their dreams, offshoring their jobs, opening borders, and sending their sons and daughters to fight in endless foreign wars that never ended.

He says he ran for president because he could not watch this betrayal of our country and watch other countries take advantage of us on trade, borders, foreign policy, and national defense.

10:35 PM: Trump says this election is about the American dream versus socialism. He says it’s about protecting law-abiding citizens vs. giving free reign to agitators and criminals who threaten our citizens. He says it’s about defending the American way of life or allowing radicals to destroy it.

He says at the DNC, Biden assailed America as a land of racial, social, and economic injustice. He says how can Democrats ask to lead our country when they spend so much time tearing down our country.

He says the left sees America as a nation that must be “punished” for its wickedness. They say redemption can only be given by giving power to them. He says in America, we don’t turn to government to restore our souls. We put our faith in Almighty God.

10:30 PM: Trump “profoundly” accepts the nomination for president of the United States with a heart full of gratitude and boundless optimism.

He says the Republican Party goes forward to welcome Democrats, independents, and anyone else who believes in the righteous hearts of the American people. He says we will rebuild the greatest economy in American history in the next term while defending American against all threats and protecting American against all dangers. Trump talks about reaching new heights of national achievement and a “new spirit of unity that can only be realized through love of our great country.”

Trump says America is not a land cloaked in darkness but a torch that lights the world.

Trump speaks about the “invisible enemy” and says there will be a vaccine before the end of the year and maybe even sooner. He says we will defeat the virus, end the pandemic, and emerge stronger than ever before.

10:25 PM: Trump now up to speak as the audience chants “USA!” and “four more years!”

Trump says he is brimming with confidence in the bright future we will build over the next four years. He sends our thoughts are with the wonderful people who have come through the wrath of Hurricane Laura. Trump thanks the “magnificent” Melania for her service to the nation.

9:54 PM: Alice Johnson says she was told she would only be reunited with her family as a corpse. She assures everyone she is not a ghost and she is free.

“Some say, ‘You do the crime. You do the time.’ However, that time should be fair and just. We’ve all made mistakes, and none of us want to be defined forever based on our worst decision,” she says. “While in prison, I became a playwright, a mentor, a certified hospice volunteer, an ordained minister, and received the Special Olympics Event Coordinator of the year award for my work with disabled women. Because the only thing worse than unjustly imprisoning my body, is trying to imprison my mind.”

She says her transformation was described as extraordinary and her Christian faith and the prayers of so many kept hope alive.

She says Trump had compassion and acted when he heard her story.

“I couldn’t believe it. I always remembered that God knew my name, even in my darkest hour. But I never thought a president would,” Johnson says.

She says she is using her voice to tell the stories of others like others and praises Trump for signing the First Step Act into law six months after she was freed.

9:48 PM: Carl and Marsha Mueller, the parents of the late Kayla Mueller, are speaking. Carl says al-Baghdadi raped his daughter repeatedly while beating and torturing her.

“We put all our faith in the government. But our government let us down. President Obama refused to meet with us until ISIS had already beheaded other Americans. To this day, we’ve never heard from Joe Biden. Instead, the Obama administration hid behind policy so much that we felt hopeless when they kept us from negotiating to save Kayla’s life,” Carl Mueller says. “The administration showed more concern for the terrorists in Guantanamo than for the American hostages in Syria.”

He says the “military prepared a rescue mission, but the White House delayed it. By the time it went forward, Kayla had been moved to a different location.”

“What a difference a president makes,” he continues.

“The Trump team gave us empathy we never received from the Obama administration. The Obama administration said it was doing everything it could. The Trump administration is,” he says. “Let me just say this: Kayla should be here. If Donald Trump had been President when Kayla was captured, she would be here today.”

9:46 PM. Sen. Cotton says Obama’s secretary of defense said Biden has gotten almost every foreign policy decision wrong and compares Biden’s foreign policy record to Trump’s:

Joe Biden slashed defense spending again and again. President Trump rebuilt our military—and added the Space Force.

Joe Biden let ISIS terrorists rampage across the Middle East. President Trump eliminated ISIS’s leader—and destroyed its caliphate.

Joe Biden opposed the mission to kill Osama bin Laden. President Trump avenged the murder of hundreds of Americans by killing Iran’s terrorist mastermind, Qassim Soleimani.

Joe Biden sent pallets of cash to the ayatollahs. President Trump ripped up the dangerous Iran nuclear deal.

Joe Biden treated Israel like a nuisance. President Trump moved our embassy to Jerusalem and brokered peace deals in the Middle East.

Joe Biden coddled socialist dictators in Cuba and Venezuela. President Trump fights against communism—in America’s backyard and around the world.

And on the Communist Party of China, there is no comparison.

Joe Biden aided and abetted China’s rise for fifty years with terrible trade deals that closed our factories and laid off our workers. President Trump stands up to China’s cheating, and stealing, and lying.

Joe Biden allowed Chinese fentanyl to flood across our southern border. President Trump sanctioned Chinese drug dealers for poisoning our kids.

After saying China is rooting for Biden, Cotton says we need a president who stands up for America, not someone like Biden who will take a knee.

Sen. Tom Cotton: “We need a president who stands up for America — not one to takes a knee. A strong and proud America is a safe America.” https://t.co/SssWAdjj98 #RNC2020 pic.twitter.com/PAZ3AmRdFD — ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) August 28, 2020

“No one who’s seen the face of war desires to see it again. Too many of our fellow Americans are already honored at the hallowed grounds of Arlington,” Cotton continues. “But if we want peace, we must be strong. Weakness is provocative. President Trump’s strength has kept us out of war. Joe Biden won’t stand up for America. Donald Trump will. So this November, let’s stand with the president and vote to keep America great.”

9:36 PM: Giuliani says don’t let Democrats do to America what they have done to New York. He says New Yorkers are wondering “how did we get overwhelmed by crime so quickly and decline so fast.” He says this “unprecedented wave of lawlessness began with a truly just cause– the unforgiveable police killing of George Floyd.”

He accuses BLM and Antifa of hijacking peaceful protest into vicious and brutal riots because a “unified proposal to reduce police misconduct” would make Trump seem like a leader.

Giuliani talks about the murder of 4-year old LeGen Taliferro in Kansas City, 17-year-old New York basketball Star Brandon Hendricks, who had committed to St. John’s, one-year-old Davell Gardner, Jr., who was shot and killed in a stroller at a cook-out in Brooklyn. He said these murders caused no outrage on the left.

“For President Trump, and for us Republicans, all Black Lives Matter and the lives of LaGen, Brandon and Davell matter to us,” he says.

He cites the murders in Chicago and presumes Black lives in Chicago did not matter to Obama-Biden. He says the crime wave will continue if Biden is elected and says this is something that cannot be solved from Biden’s basement.

“There is no question that this awesome job of restoring safety cannot be done from your basement, Joe,” he says.

9:33 PM: Police Benevolent Association President Pat Lynch of New York says the stakes have never been higher.

“Like cops across this country, we are staring down the barrel of a public safety disaster,” he says.

He says people in the community ask him every day why so many people are getting murdered. He says “the answer is simple: The Democrats have walked away from us. Democratic politicians have surrendered our streets and institutions.”

He says Democrats have passed laws that have made it impossible for police officers to work without their hands tied behind their backs.

There is nobody who hates bad cops more than good cops, but that doesn’t matter to the radical left. To them, we’re all bad, because we’re all blue. Their anti-law enforcement campaign isn’t about a single incident. It’s about a message. The message is: police officers are the enemy.

The message is: criminals have the right to resist arrest. The message is: if you victimize a vulnerable person, the justice system will not hold you accountable,” he says. “The criminals have heard that message, and they are taking full advantage. We must stop that message. We must expose the left’s lies about police officers and the job we do.”

He says while Democrats are running in fear of the mob in the streets, Trump has never apologized “for standing up for law and order.”

9:25 PM: Dr. Ben Carson says his heart goes out to the Blake family.

Ben Carson: ""Our hearts go out to the Blake family, and the other families who've been impacted by the tragic events in Kenosha."" Full #RNC2020 video here: https://t.co/ZpNptJvTzQ pic.twitter.com/woWRKI7PlC — CSPAN (@cspan) August 28, 2020

“In order to succeed in change, we must first come together in love of our fellow citizens,” Carson says.

He says Trump believes in the people and is “one of us.”

He does not submit to political correctness or to its enforcers, the media. He is real.

“Right now, we need real. We need courage. We can’t cower in the corner and hope that no one calls us a name, believing that will keep us safe. That is not courage, and that will not lead us to a good and just place,” Carson says. “We must remember all those who sacrificed everything in order to give us freedom, and we must be willing to do the same for those who come after us.”

He says Trump also doesn’t dabble in identity politics and wants everyone to succeed.

“Many on the other side love to incite division by claiming that President Trump is a racist. They could not be more wrong,” Carson says. “Years ago, Jesse Jackson gave Donald Trump an award for the economic opportunities he created for Black people. In Palm Beach, Florida, Donald Trump led the crusade to allow blacks and Jews into private clubs and resorts. One of the first things he did as president was bring the Office of Historically Black Colleges and Universities into the White House so that it could get proper attention and financial support. Before the pandemic, African American unemployment was at an all-time low.”

Carson also touts Trump’s prison reform agenda and support for school choice.

Carson says what “is racist is the fact that African Americans have the highest abortion rate,” and he hails Trump as the most pro-life president.

9;19 PM: Ann Dorn—the widow of the late David Dorn, a retired police officer whom a looter murdered during the George Floyd protests in St Louis–says her husband “had a big smile and a heart to match. He was blessed with the gift of gab, and that gift enabled him to touch souls and inspire people, especially young people.”

He says after David retired, he still befriended everyone. She talks about a young man named Lee who opened a pawn shop. Whenever the shop’s alarm went off, the alarm company called Dave…She says most of the alarms were false alarms:

The alarm that went off the morning of June 2nd was for real. It was a violent night in St. Louis. Four police officers were shot. Others were hit with rocks and fireworks. At least 55 businesses were damaged, looted, or set on fire. As the Officer Wellness and CIT Coordinator with the police department, I was keenly aware of the rioting and spent the evening getting ready to mobilize support for officers who were impacted. After I had gone to bed, Dave received a call from Lee’s alarm company. The front door of the pawn shop had been breached. This time, he didn’t wake me up to tell me. He probably knew I would have tried to stop him or insisted on going with him. As I slept, looters were ransacking the shop. They shot and killed Dave in cold blood and then live-streamed the execution and his last moments on this earth. Dave’s grandson was watching the video on Facebook in real time, not realizing he was watching his own grandfather dying on the sidewalk.

She says she re-lives this horror in her mind every day.

“My hope is that having you re-live it with me now will help shake this country from this nightmare we’re witnessing in our cities and bring about positive, peaceful change,” she says. “How did we get to this point where so many young people are so callous and indifferent towards human life? This isn’t a video game where you can commit mayhem and then hit reset and bring all the characters back to life. David is never coming back to me. He was murdered by people who didn’t know, and just didn’t care.”

Ann Dorn says “violence and destruction are not legitimate forms of protest. They do not safeguard black lives.” She says Trump knows we need more Davids in our communities–not fewer.

9:15 PM: Debbie Flood, who owns a small foundry and machine shop in Wisconsin that manufactures cast bronze architectural hardware, says she lost nearly 50% of her business to China in the mid-2000s. She wondered how a small company like hers could continue to compete.

“At the time, Joe Biden was a senator,” she says. “He voted to normalize trade with China and helped pave the way for them to join the WTO, even though they were hurting American companies like ours.”

She says that when “Donald Trump was elected, and we breathed a sigh of relief.”

“He actually fought for American workers and American craftsmen,” she says. “He actually cared about bringing back those three beautiful words, ‘Made in America.'”

She says Biden doesn’t know anything about creating jobs or business. She says he has spent 47 years in government and it is doubtful he will figure it out in year 48.

9:10 PM: Utah Attorney General Sean Reyes talks about his Hawaiian, Filipino, Japanese and Spanish ancestry.

“My father demonstrated his warrior spirit over 50 years ago fighting a dictator in his homeland–the Philippines. Barely escaping with his life, he started anew in America,” he says. “He arrived with nothing but faith, determination and a willingness to work hard. He lived the American Dream, building businesses, a family and seeing me become Utah’s first minority statewide elected official. Today, I channel my warrior roots by battling human trafficking.”

He says he has led some of the largest human trafficking prosecutions and “President Donald Trump is a fierce warrior against human trafficking.” He says Trump asked insightful questions and “promised to attack this evil” when they met in 2017.

Reyes says he lost his father to cancer a few months ago: “When he passed, he had by his bedside: his scriptures, family photos and a pen President Trump gave me to give him. Dad loved that pen. It represented freedom to him, the freedom that only exists when someone is willing to fight for it”

“To my father, President Trump is that ultimate warrior fighting for our freedom,” he continues. “If you listen to Democrats, the media, and liberal elite, they will tell you that America’s light doesn’t shine as brightly around the world as it once did. That’s simply not true. The same light that brought my father to America inspires the desperate and downtrodden equally today.”

9:05 PM: UFC’s Dana White touts Trump’s economic accomplishments and rails against people who want to defund the police. He praises Trump for working to bring back the economy safely after COVID hit.

8:59 PM: Mitch McConnell says today’s Democrats do not want to improve the lives of those living in Middle America. He says Democrats want to defund the police and take away your Second Amendment rights. They want to give free health care to illegal immigrants and offer no protections to the unborn. He says with two more liberal Senators, we can’t undo the damage they will do. He says that is why Democrats spent two weeks not saying anything about what Joe Biden will do before saying the GOP Senate is the “firewall” against Nancy Pelosi’s agenda.

8:54 PM: Dan Scavino, who has been working for Trump for 30 years, says he never would have imagined he would be working for Trump for three decades.

“All these years later, there is a part of me that still feels a sense of wonder every day when I consider the journey we have taken together — and taken with so many of you watching tonight,” he says. “Because my personal story with Donald Trump, in so many ways, is your story, too. He saw potential in me. A spark. The possibility that I could be more, do more, and achieve more than even I thought was possible. That’s how he views this country, too. We have all just scratched the surface of what we can do together.”

He says if there is one thing viewers take away from him tonight, “it is this–President Trump is a kind and decent man. I wish you could be at his side with me to see his endless kindness to everyone he meets.”

He says Trump can’t be bought, bullied, or beaten.

“President Trump is the first leader who’s been too strong, too tough, and too savvy to be crushed by the status quo establishment and the political media class,” he says before saying what they call “chaos,” Trump calls “change.”

He says Trump is a man of the people and points out the RNC featured real Americans “who are just like us.”

8:51 PM: Stacia Brightmon talks about having been homeless and finding out about from the Texas Workforce Commission about S&B’s Women in Construction Earn-While-You-Learn apprenticeship program. She says President Trump backed “policies that made it easy for states and companies to give opportunities to hardworking Americans” like her.

8:45 PM: Rep. Jeff Van Drew says how he became a Republican says a lot about today’s Democrats. He says Democrats had become less accepting of American traditions and exceptionalism. He says it was not the party he knew and says his first vote in the House was against the San Francisco liberal for House Speaker. He says, with the Squad, Democrats went from being liberal to radical and were no longer about just raising taxes. They were also for open borders. He says he voted no on impeachment and met with Trump soon after and the president made him feel more comfortable than Pelosi made him feel in her caucus. He says he then became a Republican a few days later. He says when Democrats tried to order him around, he said he had had enough with their radical, socialist agenda. He says Biden “is being told what to do by the radicals running my former party.”

8:40 PM: Ja’Ron Smith, deputy assistant to the president, says the media don’t show faces like his parents’ when they talk about struggling Americans. He said he didn’t know a Republican growing up and believed all the stereotypes. He says Trump cares about every issue important to Black communities and talks about Trump’s funding for HBCUs and fight for school choice. He says he has shown the “deep empathy” Trump has shown the families who have been killed by senseless violence after mentioning the deaths of George Floyd and Ahmaud Arbery. He says Trump has a lot of Cleveland in him for a New Yorker.

Last week, C-SPAN reported that Biden’s 24.5-minute acceptance speech had been the shortest since Walter Mondale’s 32.5-minute speech in 1984.

The longest convention acceptance speech, C-SPAN noted at the time, had been President Bill Clinton’s acceptance speech at the DNC in Chicago in 1996, when he was nominated for reelection by his party and spoke for 64.5 minutes.

Trump one-hour-and-ten-minute oration exceeded Clinton’s mark by about 5 minutes — not including the fireworks and opera that followed:

The president’s speech capped an emotional evening, featuring a testimonial from the widow of retired police captain David Dorn, killed in Black Lives Matter riots earlier this year; praise for Trump’s criminal justice reforms from freed prisoner Alice Johnson; and a speech by the parents of Kayla Mueller, an American slain by ISIS.

The setting provoked controversy, as journalists and Democrats complained that Trump was using the White House (and, later, the Washington Monument) for partisan election displays.

Protesters gathered outside the White House and attempted to disrupt the speeches before marching through the city.

Tens of thousands of demonstrators are expected in Washington, DC, on Friday for a political rally organized by Al Sharpton to coincide with the anniversary of the 1963 March on Washington.

“The Biden Plan would eliminate America’s borders in the middle of a global pandemic … they want to open our borders while living in walled-off compounds and communities,” Trump said.

“When I took bold action to issue a travel ban on China, Joe Biden called it hysterical and xenophobic,” Trump said. “If we had listened to Joe, hundreds of thousands more Americans would have died.”

Biden has vowed to end deportations of criminal illegal aliens on day one of his administration and has long opposed Trump’s travel bans on China to stop the spread of the coronavirus. Biden has since said he supports a travel ban, though his plan to handle the coronavirus does not include travel bans on China, Brazil, Europe, or Iran.

Trump said:

Last year, over 1,000 African Americans were murdered as a result of violent crime in just four Democrat-run cities. The top ten most dangerous cities in the country are run by Democrats and have been for decades. Thousands more African Americans are victims of violent crime in these communities. Joe Biden and the left ignore these American victims. I never will.

Trump added:

If the radical left takes power, they will apply their disastrous policies to every city, town, and suburb in America. Just imagine if the so-called peaceful demonstrators in the streets were in charge of every lever of power in the U.S. government. Liberal politicians claim to be concerned about the strength of American institutions. But who, exactly, is attacking them? Who is hiring the radical professors, judges, and prosecutors? Who is trying to abolish immigration enforcement and establish speech codes designed to muzzle dissent? In every case, the attacks on American institutions are being waged by the radical left. Always remember, they are coming after me because I am fighting for you.

Trump highlighted Biden’s opposition to charter schools and education reform as an example of left-wing policies that disproportionately and negatively impact black families. “Biden also vowed to oppose school choice and close down charter schools, ripping away the ladder of opportunity for black and Hispanic children,” he said.

Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Ben Carson highlighted the disparate use of abortion among blacks relative to the broader U.S. population during his RNC address earlier on Thursday night.

“Joe Biden is not the savior of America’s soul — he is the destroyer of America’s jobs, and if given the chance, he will be the destroyer of American greatness,” Trump said.

“For 47 years, Joe Biden took the donations of blue-collar workers, gave them hugs and even kisses, and told them he felt their pain — and then he flew back to Washington and voted to ship their jobs to China and many other distant lands,” Trump continued:

Joe Biden spent his entire career outsourcing the dreams of American workers, offshoring their jobs, opening their borders, and sending their sons and daughters to fight in endless foreign wars. Four years ago, I ran for president because I could not watch this betrayal of our country any longer. I could not sit by as career politicians let other countries take advantage of us on trade, borders, foreign policy, and national defense. [Emphasis added]

Biden, while in the Senate, supported China entering the World Trade Organization (WTO), voted for the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), and supported normalizing United States’ trade relations with China.

As a result, the WTO-NAFTA period before Trump’s election — where he put tariffs on Chinese products and replaced NAFTA — resulted in the loss of nearly five million American manufacturing jobs and at least 55,000 U.S. manufacturing plants across the nation.

Trump also touted his ending of Biden and President Obama’s Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP).

“Days after taking office, we shocked the Washington establishment and withdrew from the last administration’s job-killing Trans-Pacific Partnership,” Trump said.

During the later years of the Obama administration, Biden as vice president toured the nation promoting TPP. Research has shown that TPP, if not killed by Trump, would have provided incentives for big businesses to offshore U.S. jobs.

“Fast-tracking TPP would make it easier for corporations to offshore U.S. jobs and push down our wages by forcing Americans to compete with workers in Vietnam who make less than 60 cents an hour and in Malaysia, where forced labor is widely used,” an analysis by Public Citizen noted.

Trump said he will impose tariffs on the products of any American corporation that offshores jobs to foreign countries rather than keeping them in the United States.

“We will also provide tax credits to bring jobs out of China back to America, and we will impose tariffs on any company that leaves America to produce jobs overseas,” Trump said. “We’ll make sure our companies and jobs stay in our country, as I’ve already been doing. Joe Biden’s agenda is Made in China. My agenda is Made in the USA.”

Trump noted Biden’s support for the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), a free trade deal that would have forced American workers to compete against low-wage workers in Vietnam and Malaysia.

“As Vice President, he supported the Trans-Pacific Partnership which would have been a death sentence for the U.S. auto industry,” Trump said. “He backed the horrendous South Korea trade deal, which took many jobs from our country.”

Thanks to Biden’s help, with his support of normalizing U.S. trade relations with China, the nation’s trade deficit with China has eliminated at least 3.5 million American jobs since 2001.

Recently, before his aides walked back the statement, Biden said he would end Trump’s tariffs on billions of dollars worth of China-made goods. Likewise, in 2019, Biden criticized Trump’s tariffs on China.

In his lengthy speech, President Trump told a crowd gathered outside on the White House lawn of his many accomplishments for African-Americans and minorities residing in America. He recalled:

To bring prosperity to our forgotten inner cities, we worked hard to pass historic criminal justice reform, prison reform, opportunity zones, and long-term funding of historically black colleges and universities, and, before the China Virus came in, produced the best unemployment numbers for African-Americans, Hispanic-Americans, and Asian-Americans ever recorded.

President Trump went on to claim that he has done more for African-Americans than any president since Abraham Lincoln, who served the nation from 1861 until 1865.

“I say very modestly that I have done more for the African-American community than any president since Abraham Lincoln, our first Republican president,” Trump said, before discussing former vice president Joe Biden.

“I have done more in three years for the black community than Joe Biden has done in 47 years,” Trump stated. “When I’m reelected, the best is yet to come.”

In the wake of the “#metoo” movement that emerged in late 2017, Biden’s lifelong habit of kissing, touching, and sniffing women — particularly younger women — at public events fell under public scrutiny, beyond the conservative media alone.

Many women came forward with complaints. One, Tara Reade, claimed Biden sexually assaulted her in a Senate hallway.

Biden posted a video saying that he was simply a tactile politician, to both men and women, but promised to change.

In his RNC address formally accepting his party’s nomination for re-election as president, Trump sought to contrast Biden’s supposed empathy for working Americans with his actual behavior in Washington. But he added a joke at Biden’s expense:

“Don’t let Democrats do to America what they have done to New York!” he said.

Giuliani, who is widely credited with restoring law, order, and prosperity to New York in the 1990s, described his city’s decline since “progressive Democrat” Bill de Blasio was elected mayor in 2013 — the first Democrat to run the city since Giuliani unseated David Dinkins in 1993.

He said:

In 2013 my city elected a self described “progressive Democrat” as mayor. New York City, once described as America’s crime capital, had become, by the mid-1990s, America’s safest large city. Now, today, my city is in shock. Murders, shootings, and violent crime are increasing at percentages unheard of in the past. We are seeing the return of rioting and looting. During riots, this Democrat mayor, like others, has often prevented the police from making arrests. And even when arrests are made liberal, “progressive” DAs release the rioters so as not to disrupt the rioting. New Yorkers wonder: “How did we get overwhelmed by crime so quickly, and decline so fast?” Don’t let Democrats do to America what they have done to New York!

Calling Democratic Party nominee Joe Biden an “obviously defective candidate,” Giuliani said that the former vice president “has changed his principles so often, he no longer has any principles.”

He then addressed the “unprecedented wave of lawlessness” in the country that he said “began with a truly just cause — the unforgiveable police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis on May 25, 2020.”

Despite the universal condemnation of the killing, the left rejected bipartisan efforts at police reform, Giuliani said, because of their desire for political power:

It seemed for a ‘a few brief shining moments’ like Democrat and Republican leaders would come together with a unified proposal to reduce police misconduct. This possibility was very dangerous to the Left. They had a President to beat and a country to destroy.

Giuliani noted that President Trump supported law enforcement because he believed that black Americans, too, deserved to live in safety, free from crime. “For President Trump and us Republicans, all black lives matter.”

He also addressed Biden directly: “This awesome job of restoring safety for our peoplee, cannot be done from your basement, Joe!:

He concluded: “Mr. President, Make our nation safe again!”

Tom Cotton (R-AR) said during the Republican National Convention (RNC) on Thursday evening that former Vice President Joe Biden “aided and abetted” China’s rise for 50 years, which led to American job losses and Chinese fentanyl flooding through America’s borders.

“Joe Biden aided and abetted China’s rise for fifty years with terrible trade deals that closed our factories and laid off our workers. President Trump stands up to China’s cheating, and stealing, and lying,” Cotton said.

Cotton charged that, unlike Joe Biden, Trump has worked to counter China’s rise and crack down on China’s malfeasance. He said:

Joe Biden allowed Chinese fentanyl to flood across our southern border. President Trump sanctioned Chinese drug dealers for poisoning our kids. Joe Biden said the Chinese Communists aren’t even our competitors, aren’t “bad folks” — just months before they unleashed this plague on the world. President Trump is clear-eyed about the Chinese threat, and he’s making China pay. But China’s not giving up — in fact, they’re rooting for Joe Biden. America’s other enemies won’t give up either. But Joe Biden would be as wrong and weak over the next four years as he has been for the last fifty.

In contrast, Cotton said that Trump continues to fight for America, unlike Biden. He said:

We need a president who stands up for America — not one who takes a knee. A strong and proud America is a safe America — safe from our enemies and safe from war.

“In 2013, my city elected a self described Progressive Democrat as Mayor,” the Big Apple’s former mayor said.

“New York City, once described as America’s Crime Capital, had become by the mid-1990s America’s safest large city. Now today my city is in shock. Murders, shootings, and violent crime are increasing at percentages unheard of in the past,” he said.

“We are seeing the return of rioting and looting. During riots, this Democrat mayor like others has often prevented the police from making arrests. Even when arrests are made liberal, progressive DAs release the rioters so as not to disrupt the looting,” Giuliani said.

He said New Yorkers wonder how they got into this situation.

“They elected (Bill) de Blasio because of their reflexive historical instinct to vote for a Democrat just because he was a Democrat and not to consider carefully his destructive policies and inadequate background,” he said.

“Don’t let Democrats do to America what they have done to New York!” Giuliani proclaimed.

The former mayor then turned his sights on Joe Biden.

“Biden has changed his principles so often, he no longer has any principles,” he said. “He disavowed his authorship of the 1994 Crime Bill.”

“He’s a Trojan Horse with Bernie (Sanders), (Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez), (Nancy) Pelosi, Black Lives Matter, and his party’s entire Left Wing hidden inside his body just waiting to execute their pro-criminal, anti-police policies,” Giuliani said.

“We need a president who stands up for America — not one who takes a knee,” Cotton said. “A strong and proud America is a safe America — safe from our enemies and safe from war.”

Cotton charged during his speech that Trump has worked during his first term to strengthen America’s military and position in the world, which has led to greater peace.

“No one who’s seen the face of war desires to see it again. Too many of our fellow Americans are already honored at the hallowed grounds of Arlington,” Cotton said. “But if we want peace, we must be strong. Weakness is provocative. President Trump’s strength has kept us out of war.”

Other members of Congress, such as Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) and Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL), have praised Trump’s foreign policy for resisting war and pursuing peace.

Paul said during the RNC that former Vice President Joe Biden will to continue to “spill our blood and treasure” should he become the 46th president of the United States.

He said:

I can tell you the president not only felt the pain of these families, but that the president is committed to ending this war. President Trump is the first president in a generation to seek to end war rather than start one. He intends to end the war in Afghanistan. He is bringing our men and women home.

“Before I begin, I’d like to say that our hearts go out to the Blake family and the other families who’ve been impacted by the tragic events Kenosha,” Carson began.

“As Jacob’s mother has urged the country, let’s use our hearts our love and our intelligence to work together to show the rest of the world how humans are supposed to treat each other,” he said, stressing that “America is great when we behave greatly.”

Trump said:

To bring prosperity to our forgotten inner cities, we worked hard to pass historic criminal justice reform, prison reform, opportunity zones, the longterm funding of historically black colleges and universities, and, before the China Virus came in, produced the best unemployment numbers for African Americans, Hispanic Americans, and Asian Americans ever recorded. I have done more for the African American community than any president since Abraham Lincoln, our first Republican president. I have done more in three years for the black community than Joe Biden has done in 47 years—and when I’m reelected, the best is yet to come!

Trump made several references to Biden’s nearly five decades as a politician, with repeated references to the former vice president’s support for trade policies, including the North American NAFTA, China’s entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO).

Trump remarked, “Biden’s record is a shameful roll call of the most catastrophic betrayals and blunders in our lifetime. He has spent his entire career on the wrong side of history. Biden voted for the NAFTA disaster, the single worst trade deal ever enacted. He supported China’s entry into the World Trade Organization, one of the greatest economic disasters of all time. After those Biden calamities, the United States lost one in four manufacturing jobs. The laid off workers in Michigan, Ohio, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, and many other states didn’t want Joe Biden’s hollow words of empathy; they wanted their jobs back!”

The president continued, “As vice president, he supported the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which would have been a death sentence for the U.S. auto industry. He backed the horrendous South Korea trade deal, which took many jobs from our country. He repeatedly supported mass amnesty for illegal immigrants.”

The president spoke at length about his efforts to deliver fair trade, border security, and law and order for the American people, recalling the promises he made in 2016.

“I did what our political establishment never expected and could never forgive, breaking the cardinal rule of Washington politics,” he said. “I kept my promise.”

The president’s 70-minute speech was among the longest convention speeches in modern history, as he spoke about his victories in the swamp of Washington, DC.

Trump acknowledged that he faced doubt from the Washington political establishment when it came to issues of tough trade negotiations with China and renegotiating NAFTA.

“Washington insiders asked me not to stand up to China. They pleaded with me to let China continue stealing our jobs, ripping us off and robbing our country blind, but I kept my word to the American people,” he said.

But he set the biggest contrast between himself and his agenda versus that of former Vice President Joe Biden.

On every issue, Trump offered brutal criticism of former Vice President Joe Biden, his Democrat opponent for the presidency.

Biden, the president said, would only turn the country back to the failed political establishment.

“Joe Biden is not a savior of America’s soul. He is the destroyer of America’s jobs, and if given the chance, he will be the destroyer of America’s greatness,” he said.

Biden, he said, would only sell out future generations by rolling back his hard-earned gains.

“Joe Biden’s agenda is Made in China. My agenda is made in the USA,” Trump said, as the crowd applauded and cheered.

Trump accused Biden of pandering to working-class Americans as a Democrat and betraying them in Washington.

“For 47 years, Joe Biden took the donations of blue-collar workers, gave them hugs and even kisses, and told them he felt their pain,” he said. “And then he flew back to Washington and voted to ship their jobs to China and many other distant lands.”

Trump also vowed to protect the unborn and the Second Amendment, reminding his supporters of the stark contrast on issues important to his base.

“Democrat politicians refuse to protect innocent life, and then they lecture us about morality and saving America’s soul?” he asked. “Tonight, we proudly declare that all children, born and unborn, have a God-given right to life!”

Most of all, Trump’s long-held belief in law and order and respect for law enforcement officers spoke volumes as the noise from angry protests outside the White House echoed around the building during moments of his speech.

Anti-Trump protesters brought a guillotine outside the White House and even beheaded a dummy that looked like the president as they shouted “F-ck Trump!”

“If the Democrat party wants to stand with anarchists, agitators, rioters, looters, and flag-burners, that is up to them,” Trump said. But I, as your President, will not be part of it.”

Trump also smashed the Democrat political elites for trying to tear away opportunities for lower classes while enjoying the fruits of their privilege, describing them as “liberal hypocrites who drive their cities into the ground while fleeing far from the scene of the wreckage.”

“These same liberals want to eliminate school choice, while they enroll their children in the finest private schools in the land,” he continued. “They want to open our borders while living in walled-off compounds and communities. They want to defund the police, while they have armed guards for themselves.”

The president also directly addressed cancel culture — a new theme rising to the forefront of concern among his supporters in 2020.

“The goal of cancel culture is to make decent Americans live in fear of being fired, expelled, shamed, humiliated, and driven from society as we know it,” he said. “The far-left wants to coerce you into saying what you know to be false and scare you out of saying what you know to be true.”

Trump also accused liberals of tearing down America’s institutions, despite their claim that Trump was betraying the country’s principals.

“Who is hiring the radical professors, judges, and prosecutors? Who is trying to abolish immigration enforcement and establish speech codes designed to muzzle dissent?” he asked. “In every case, the attacks on American institutions are being waged by the radical left.”

Trump’s lengthy speech was capped by an enormous fireworks display over the Washington Memorial firing up the words “TRUMP 2020” when the president was finished speaking.

Trump drew a stark contrast between his pro-life policies and the pro-abortion agenda of Joe Biden and the Democrat Party, one that would codify Roe v. Wade, fully fund Planned Parenthood, and force American taxpayers to fund abortion on demand:

Joe Biden claims he has empathy for the vulnerable – yet the party he leads supports the extreme late-term abortion of defenseless babies right up to the moment of birth. Democrat leaders talk about moral decency, but they have no problem with stopping a baby’s beating heart in the 9th month of pregnancy.

“Democrat politicians refuse to protect innocent life, and then they lecture us about morality and saving America’s soul?” the president questioned. “Tonight, we proudly declare that all children, born and unborn, have a God-given right to life.”

Despite embracing the most extreme abortion rights agenda in history, Democrats avoided the issue almost entirely during their convention last week.

The RNC, however, prominently featured numerous pro-life speakers, including former Planned Parenthood director-turned pro-life advocate Abby Johnson; Covington Catholic High School graduate Nick Sandmann; Catholic nun and medical doctor Sister Deirdre Byrne; former Notre Dame football coach Lou Holtz; human rights activist Chen Guangcheng; Ohio mother Tera Myers, who rejected the advice of her doctor to abort her son with Down syndrome; and others.

In a statement sent to Breitbart News, Marjorie Dannenfelser, national co-chair of Pro-Life Voices for Trump and president of the Susan B. Anthony List, praised the president for calling out the extremism of the Democrat Party on abortion:

President Trump’s speech marks the pinnacle of the most explicitly pro-life Republican convention ever. While Joe Biden, Kamala Harris and other leading Democrats downplay their radical and deeply unpopular agenda, President Trump and Vice President Pence continually call out the Democrats for supporting abortion on demand through birth and even infanticide, paid for by taxpayers. In stark contrast to the Democrats, who were too afraid to even utter the word ‘abortion’ during four days of national television coverage, they are using their platform to promote a multitude of diverse pro-life voices.

“Thanks to the extraordinary leadership of our pro-life president and vice president, Republicans are unified and energized on this issue like never before and life is truly winning in America,” Dannenfelser said.","Trump: ‘All Children, Born and Unborn, Have a God-Given Right to Life’",fake

“Joe Biden and his supporters remained completely silent about the rioters and criminals spreading mayhem in Democrat-run cities. They never even mentioned it during their entire convention,” Trump said.

The president accused the Biden campaign and Biden himself of speaking up, finally, for political reasons.

“Now, they’re starting to mention it because their poll numbers are going down like a rock in water,” Trump said. “Too late, Joe.”

Trump spoke about the weeks of violent left-wing protests, looting, and arsonists taking advantage of civil unrest to create anarchy in America’s major cities.

“Joe Biden’s campaign did not condemn it; they donated to it,” Trump said, recalling members of Biden’s campaign publicly trumpeting their donations to the Minnesota Freedom Fund, which helped bail out arrested protesters and agitators in Minneapolis.

“At least 13 members of Joe Biden’s campaign staff donated to a fund to bail out vandals, arsonists, anarchists, looters, and rioters from jail,” he said.

Instead, Trump pointed to the death of retired police Captain David Dorn, who was shot and killed during the riots in Saint Louis while trying to protect a store from being looted.

Dorn’s family was present in the audience, including his wife, Ann, who spoke during the convention.

“President Trump does not dabble in identity politics,” Carson said. “He wants everyone to succeed and believes in the adage, ‘a rising tide lifts all boats.’ Many on the other side love to incite division by claiming that President Trump is a racist. They could not be more wrong.” He went on to say:

Years ago, Jesse Jackson gave Donald Trump an award for the economic opportunities he created for black people. In Palm Beach, Florida, Donald Trump led the crusade to allow blacks and Jews into private clubs and resorts. One of the first things he did as president was bring the Office of Historically Black Colleges and Universities into the White House so that it could get proper attention and financial support. Before the pandemic, African American unemployment was at an all-time low.

Carson noted that Trump has addressed criminal justice reform, which is helping blacks who are serving unfair and lengthy prison sentences. He also cited Trump’s work with HUD to encourage investing in and improving low-income neighborhoods.

Carson returned to the subject of racism and abortion.

“What is racist is the fact that African Americans have the highest abortion rate,” Carson said. “President Trump is the most pro-life President in our country’s history. He will continue to fight for those who cannot yet speak.

Republican Walt Blackman, a member of the Arizona House of Representatives representing Legislative District 6, wrote about the high rate of abortion of black babies in the Arizona Capitol Times in February 2020:

Abortion impacts African Americans at a higher rate than any other population group. In 2011, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released an Abortion Surveillance Report. According to that report, black women make up 14 percent of the childbearing population. Yet, 36 percent of all abortions were obtained by black women. At a ratio of 474 abortions per 1,000 live births, black women have the highest ratio of any group in the country. When you use those percentages, it indicates that of the over 44 million abortions since the 1973 Roe vs Wade Supreme Court ruling, 19 million black babies were aborted. African Americans are just under 13 percent of United States population. White women are five times less likely to have an abortion than black women. Perhaps it is a matter of availability. A study by Protecting Black Lives, in 2012, found that 79 percent of Planned Parenthood’s surgical abortion facilities are located within walking distance of minority communities.

Carson served as Director of Pediatric Neurosurgery at the Johns Hopkins Children’s Center, a position he assumed when he was just 33-years- old, becoming the youngest major division director in the hospital’s history, according to the RNC. Carson received dozens of honors and awards in recognition of his achievements, including the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation’s highest civilian honor.

This election, Trump said, “will decide whether we will defend the American way of life, or whether we will allow a radical movement to completely dismantle and destroy it. That won’t happen,” Trump promised, slamming Democrats for assailing America as “a land of racial, economic, and social injustice” during last week’s Democratic National Convention.

“So tonight, I ask you a simple question: How can the Democrat Party ask to lead our country when it spends so much time tearing down our country?” he posed.

Those on the left hold a “backward view,” he continued, pointing out that they do not view America as exceptional, just, or free. Rather, his opponents view America as “a wicked nation that must be punished for its sins.”

While Democrats present themselves as the antidote for the country’s redemption, Trump reminded Americans that the answer does not lie with politicians. Americans put their faith in “Almighty God.”

“Our opponents say that redemption for you can only come from giving power to them. This is a tired anthem spoken by every repressive movement throughout history,” Trump said.

“But in this country, we don’t look to career politicians for salvation. In America, we don’t turn to government to restore our souls – we put our faith in Almighty God,” he continued.

“When I’ve been completely incognito during the eight years in the White House, walking the dogs on the canal, people will come up and pet my dogs, but will not look me in the eye. They don’t know it’s me,” Obama recounted, adding later: “That is so telling of how white America views people who are not like them, like we don’t exist. And when we do exist, we exist as a threat. And that’s exhausting.”

During another part of the podcast, Obama recounted how she, daughters Sasha and Malia, and friend Denielle Pemberton-Heard went for ice cream. “We had just finished taking the girls to a soccer game. We were stopping to get ice cream and I had told the Secret Service to stand back, because we were trying to be normal, trying to go in,” Obama recalled. “There was a line, and… when I’m just a black woman, I notice that white people don’t even see me. They’re not even looking at me.”

“So I’m standing there with two little black girls, another black female adult, they’re in soccer uniforms, and a white woman cuts right in front of us to order. Like, she didn’t even see us,” the former first lady continued. “The girl behind the counter almost took her order. And I had to stand up ’cause I know Denielle was like, ‘Well, I’m not gonna cause a scene with Michelle Obama.’ So I stepped up and I said, ‘Excuse me? You don’t see us four people standing right here? You just jumped in line?'”

She added: “She didn’t apologize, she never looked me in my eye, she didn’t know it was me. All she saw was a black person, or a group of black people, or maybe she didn’t even see that. Because we were that invisible.”",Michelle Obama: White People Have Treated Me Like I Don't Exist,fake

Kelly was attacked by an inmate in a Chicago prison, according to his attorney. The singer, whose name is Robert Kelly, has been held without bond since his arrest on the federal charges in July 2019.

R. Kelly was sitting on his bed in Chicago’s Metropolitan Correctional Center when another inmate walked in his cell and started punching the singer profusely, according to a report by TMZ. The report added that sources say the inmate attacked R. Kelly because he was angry that the detention facility had been placed on lock down a few times due to Kelly protesters outside of the jail.

A spokesperson for the Federal Bureau Of Prisons told TMZ that it cannot comment on an inmate’s conditions of confinement or medical status due to privacy and safety reasons.

The site’s other sources, however, mentioned that the fight didn’t last long before it was broken up, and that R. Kelly was examined by a doctor, who concluded that the singer did not sustain any broken bones or serious injuries.

R. Kelly was charged with racketeering conspiracy in U.S. District Court in New York, which alleged that he identified underage girls attending his concerts and groomed them for sexual abuse. The Grammy-winner has been held without bond since last July.

Last year, R. Kelly pleaded not guilty to federal charges that he sexually abused women and girls who attended his concerts. The 52-year-old singer was denied bail in a New York City courtroom packed with his supporters. In April, a federal judge denied R. Kelly’s request to be release from jail due to fears concerning the Chinese coronavirus outbreak.

In a dark rant at the Democratic National Convention last week, Billie Eilish accused President Donald Trump of “destroying our country and everything we care about.”

“Donald Trump is destroying our country and everything we care about. We need leaders who will solve problems like climate change and COVID, not deny them,” Eilish said. “Leaders who will fight against systemic racism and inequality, and that starts by voting for someone who understands how much is at stake. Someone who’s building a team that shares our values. It starts with voting against Donald Trump and for Joe Biden.”

Watch below:

Cawthorn, meanwhile, who is running in North Carolina’s 11th congressional district, gave an inspiring speech and even managed to stood up out of his wheelchair, despite being left partially paralyzed by a car accident six years ago.

“I choose to fight for the future, to seize the high ground, and retake the Shining City on a Hill,” the 25-year-old declared. “While the radical left wants to dismantle, defund, and destroy, Republicans, under President Trump’s leadership, want to rebuild, restore, and renew.”

“I just turned 25. When I’m elected this November, I’ll be the youngest member of Congress in over 200 years,” Cawthorn continued. “If you don’t think young people can change the world, then you just don’t know American history.”

Watch below:

Eric Trump also gave a speech at the RNC earlier this week, where he directly addressed his father and thanked him for his accomplishments while in office.

“I miss working alongside you every day but I’m damn proud to be on the front lines of this fight,” he declared. “I am proud of what you are doing for this country. I am proud to show my children what their grandfather is fighting for. I am proud to watch you give them hell. Never stop. Continue to be unapologetic. Keep fighting for what’s right. You are making America strong again. You are making America safe again. You are making America proud again.”

West’s campaign representatives filed the candidate’s paperwork early this month but were told by Republican Secretary of State Frank LaRose’s office that it had rejected his filing of 15,000 signatures, according to the Hollywood Reporter.

In the filing, West’s attorneys said that state election law shows that Ohio had no basis for rejecting the candidate’s filing and that the state is obligated to accept any independent filing if there are no official objections recorded.

West’s nascent campaign for president has faced many problems gaining access to ballots across the country. The Jesus Is King rapper missed filing deadlines or was rejected in a group of states, including California, Florida, and Pennsylvania.

In Illinois, West’s filing was rejected because he did not have enough valid signatures on his nomination petitions. The rejection came after a Chicago politician challenged West’s petitions and a subsequent review of signatures found that many were invalid.

Wisconsin also rejected West’s filing after a 5-1 vote by the state’s bipartisan election commission. The commissioners rejected West’s filing because his campaign officials missed a 5 p.m. filing deadline by one minute. Early this month, billionaire Grammy-winner pulled his filing in New Jersey without offering an explanation.

Kanye West has made some state ballots, though. He will appear on the ballot in states including Arkansas, Colorado, Oklahoma, Utah, and Vermont.

“Ole Miss joins a long list of sports teams that have become involved in activism this week in the wake of the police shooting of Jacob Blake in Kenosha, Wisconsin. The movement began on Wednesday when the NBA playoffs were postponed amid a player strike and multiple MLB and WNBA regular season games were postponed as well.”

Ole Miss was not the only team in the state to cancel a practice in protest this week. Their cross-state rival, Mississippi State, canceled their Thursday practice and marched as well. Several NFL teams also canceled practices and a number of MLB teams postponed their games.

In the post, Stoudemire wrote, “I guess we broke the internet” and continued by noting he had his final meeting with the rabbinical court, and visited the mikvah, the ritual bath that converts immerse in before becoming officially Jewish.

The post was accompanied by a photo of Stoudemire in traditional Orthodox garb of black hat, black jacket and white shirt — and requisite black mask — against a backdrop of Jewish holy books.

He announced his Hebrew name as Yahoshafat Ben Avraham.

Stoudemire received Israeli citizenship in March 2019 while playing for Hapoel Jerusalem, a team he partly owns.

Stoudemire told Breitbart News in 2018 that converting to Judaism was the “top of my list” of things to do.

“It’s the most important thing right now,” he said.

Converting, he said, would allow him to immerse himself in Torah studies fulltime.

“Converting gives you an opportunity to truly take time out to become a student of the Torah, a biblical student, which is what I always wanted,” Stoudemire told Breitbart.

He said Israel was a “special place” for him and he had “embraced the culture.” He added his connection to the country began when he was a young boy hearing biblical stories from his mother.

Asked if his love for Israel surpasses his love of basketball, Stoudemire answered, “Basketball was my love since birth. Over time Israel developed to be the same, equal amount of love.”

On Thursday he posted a picture standing outside the Ohr Somayach Yeshiva in Jerusalem where he had been studying for his conversion, alongside fellow African-American convert, rapper Nissim Black.

The video was made to explain the Titans decision to not hold practice on Thursday in the wake of the officer-involved shooting of Jacob Blake. The opening comments are made by the Titans’ Kevin Byard, who spoke about a litany of “injustices” that he believes black people face in this country. However, at about 1:50 mark of the video, Tannehill begins speaking and makes it clear that he believes the United States itself was founded “upon racist ideas” and that those racist ideals are alive and well today.

Ryan Tannehill says the United States of America “was founded upon racist ideas…”

I am so sick of the America bashing by people who have never lived and would never live anywhere else.pic.twitter.com/xHgA8nHvyN — Armando Salguero (@ArmandoSalguero) August 28, 2020

The Titans were one of several NFL teams that chose not to practice on Thursday, in response to the Blake shooting. Though, Tannehill’s butchering of American history and regurgitating of extremely liberal talking points stand apart from the relatively mild statements that most teams released.

As Miami Herald columnist Armando Salguero said in response to critical sports writers, “ideas upon which America was founded…freedom of speech, religion, peaceable assembly, right to bear arms, all men created equal. Now you name the racist ideas upon which country was founded.”

The country was not founded on slavery because slavery was already present when America was a colony of Britain. In fact, there were a large number of people in Southern states – where nearly all the slaves were – who preferred continuing life as colonists and had no interest in fighting a war for independence.

Therefore, America did not need independence from Britain to preserve or secure an institution that was already in place and not, at least at that time, under serious threat. Instead, as Salguero rightly says, America needed independence so its citizens could have freedom of speech, religion, the right to bear arms, and all the other essential rights a citizen of Great Britain did not have.

Though, despite the colossal ignorance of Tannehill’s critique of America’s founding, it’s his criticism of America’s present and near past that deserves the harshest rebuke. By saying “those (racist) ideas of slavery have persisted throughout the last hundreds of years,” Tannehill eviscerates the legacy of Martin Luther King and dozens of other civil rights leaders who gave their lives to conquer segregation and improve opportunities for blacks. People who sacrificed to make sure America lived up to the ideals of its founding.

And now, here comes this millionaire moron to soil that legacy while he takes the “courageous stand” of skipping a practice?

The image of Tannehill talking about how racist and unfair America has been to black people while standing in a room packed with black millionaires is beyond absurd. The National Football League has likely created more black millionaires than any other country or institution in world history, and, prior to the coronavirus, blacks who didn’t play professional sports were enjoying historically low unemployment and record opportunity under the very president so many of the players -black and white – claim to dislike.

It’s unclear what these millionaire jocks think they’re going to accomplish towards fixing racism by skipping a practice. What’s becoming more and more clear, however, is that there will likely be less fans in the stands watching them when they play their games.

Axios reports that the U.S. Navy plans to use Google’s cloud and machine learning tech along with drone imagery to improve its process for determining which of its vessels and facilities are in need of repair. This development comes as the tech giant faces increased scrutiny from employees and customers over ties to the U.S. military.

In 2018, Google employees protested the company’s government contracts and work with the Pentagon to make military drones more accurate. 31,000 employees signed an open letter insisting that Google end its work on Project Maven, which was described as “a customized AI surveillance engine that uses ‘Wide Area Motion Imagery’ data captured by US Government drones to detect vehicles and other objects, track their motions, and provide results to the Department of Defense.” Google later agreed not to renew the contract.

The company previously refused to bid on the controversial JEDI contract, a Department of Defense cloud computing contract worth $10 billion, stating: “We are not bidding on the JEDI contract because first, we couldn’t be assured that it would align with our AI Principles. And second, we determined that there were portions of the contract that were out of scope with our current government certifications.”

It was later reported in May 2020 that Google had landed another major government contract. Via Axios:

Google Cloud has landed a deal to help the Defense Department detect, protect against, and respond to cyber threats, Axios has learned. The deal, with the Defense Innovation Unit (DIU), is in the “seven figures,” Google said, declining to be more specific. Why it matters: It’s a far cry from the controversial $10 billion JEDI deal, but Google hopes the win will lead to a broader deal down the road, as the Pentagon seeks to securely work with multiple public cloud providers.

Google declined to reveal how much the contract was worth but stated that the Navy “currently spends billions per year on maintaining and repairing its fleet of vessels and other platforms like aircraft and facilities.”

CNBC reports that Walmart has revealed that it is teaming up with tech giant Microsoft in a bid to purchase TikTok. Walmart shares hit a 52-week high of $139.35 on Thursday following the announcement.

TIkTok’s Chinese parent company, ByteDance, is reportedly getting to close to an agreement to sell it’s U.S., Canadian, Australian, and New Zealand operations in a deal that is expected to be in the $20 – $30 billion range. ByteDance has yet to choose a buyer but could announce a deal in the coming days according to sources.

Joining Microsoft’s bid, Walmart is now competing with another U.S. tech giant, Oracle, to buy the popular social media app. A Walmart spokesperson declined to outline how Microsoft and Walmart would split ownership of TikTok if their bid is successful. Walmart is pursuing the acquisition at a time when the retailer is attempting to better compete with Amazon.

Walmart is reportedly launching its own membership program called Walmart+ soon, essentially creating its own version of Amazon Prime which offers faster shipping times and video-on-demand services to Amazon customers.

In a statement, Walmart said that TikTok’s integration of e-commerce and advertising “is a clear benefit to creators and users in those markets.” In a full statement, Walmart said:

We believe a potential relationship with TikTok US in partnership with Microsoft could add this key functionality and provide Walmart with an important way for us to reach and serve omnichannel customers as well as grow our third-party marketplace and advertising businesses We are confident that a Walmart and Microsoft partnership would meet both the expectations of US TikTok users while satisfying the concerns of US government regulators.

Daniel Ives, the managing director and technology analyst at Wedbush Securities, described TikTok as a “huge shot in the arm” for Walmart’s e-commerce business. Ives stated: “When you think right now about going up against the 800-pound gorilla, Amazon, obviously they’ve been behind the eight ball. But Walmart could use this as a golden opportunity to partner with Microsoft and monetize the TikTok base, which could start to rival Instagram in the next few years just given its global presence.

Ives gave the bid an 85 to 90 percent chance of going through.

Reuters reports that Facebook told the news agency that Apple recently rejected its attempt to warn users that the iPhone maker would take a 30 percent cut of sales made via Facebook’s new online events feature, forcing Facebook to remove the warning before the update could be added to Facebook’s iOS app.

Facebook stated that Apple cited an App Store rule which bars developers from showing “irrelevant” information to users. Facebook said in a statement: “Now more than ever, we should have the option to help people understand where money they intend for small businesses actually goes. Unfortunately, Apple rejected our transparency notice around their 30% tax but we are still working to make that information available inside the app experience.”

Facebook announced plans to roll out the new feature earlier this month which would let online influencers and businesses host paid online events in an attempt to offset losses many have suffered due to the coronavirus pandemic. Facebook asked Apple to waive the 30 percent fee that it charges for in-app purchases so that Facebook could pass on all of the event’s revenue to business owners but Apple declined.

This issue arises as game developer Epic Games attempts to take on Apple’s in-app payment rules in court. Epic Games recently attempted to bypass Apple’s in-app payment rules by offering an alternative payment method in their popular video game Fortnite which resulted in Apple removing the app from the App Store. Apple then threatened to remove Epic’s access to the Unreal Engine gaming engine across Mac and iOS.

Breitbart News recently reported that Epic Games received a temporary restraining order against Apple, preventing the tech giant from retaliating against Epic Games’ lawsuit by terminating the company’s Apple developer accounts or restricting the use of Epic’s Unreal Engine by other developers on Apple’s platforms.

Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers stated in a recent ruling that Apple will not be required to allow Fornite back to its App Store after it was banned for adding an in-app payment system. Rogers wrote in a filing: “The Court finds that with respect to Epic Games’ motion as to its games, including Fortnite, Epic Games has not yet demonstrated irreparable harm. The current predicament appears of its own making.”

Rogers added that Epic “strategically chose to breach its agreements with Apple,” and disturbed the status quo. Rogers further argued, however, that maintaining that status quo is why she’s ruling that Apple cannot cut off access to the Unreal Engine right now. She claimed in that case it was Apple who “has chosen to act severely” by threatening the Unreal Engine and as a result the many developers that use the engine on Apple’s platforms.

An increasingly political to-and-fro that has lasted all week started on Sunday when reports emerged that the BBC was planning to drop Rule, Britannia! and Land of Hope and Glory from the Last Night of the Proms, a live annual broadcast of patriotic music that over the past half-century has become a firm part of the British summer season calendar.

Condemnation was swift, and the BBC eventually announced the music would, in fact, be performed — but without the lyrics, broadcasting the singalong pieces as instrumentals only.

Yet what was reported as the original plan and then the publicly announced compromise position both appear to be well wide of the mark for the public broadcaster, which purports to serve the nation as a unifying force, as a new YouGov poll for British broadsheet The Times reports that support for changing the event in any way is the position of a small minority.

The newspaper reported Friday that while a strong majority of 55 per cent think the event should go ahead this year as it has every year for decades before, just 16 per cent think compromising by performing the music but not the lyrics is a good idea.

Even less popular are proposals that patriotic songs shouldn’t be performed at all, up just five per cent.

BBC Vows to Make Diversity ‘Absolute Priority’ — Else Television Industry Faces Collapse https://t.co/QHPtTCOtCM — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) August 26, 2020

The small-scale culture wars battle over the music has elicited impassioned responses from both sides of the political divide. Brexit leader Nigel Farage has expressed his disgust at the milquetoast approach of the BBC, and encouraged Britons to sing the songs anyway.

The Conservative Party prime minister Boris Johnson also issued a now-rare comment on matters cultural, saying of the move by the broadcaster: “I think it’s time we stopped our cringing embarrassment about our history, about our traditions, and about our culture, and we stopped this general bought of self-recrimination and wetness”.

From the left, criticism has been sharper-tongued. Labour MP Neil Coyle waded into the debate with a series of late-night — and subsequently deleted — tweets on the matter, where he made absolutely clear what he felt about people supporting patriotic songs in the face of political correctness.

Coyle was accused of “drunk tweeting” after telling the world he thought Brexiteer patriots were “absolute sh*tbag racist w*nkers”.

BBC television’s Songs of Praise — a weekly broadcast of Christian worship music — executive producer Cat Lewis may have been gunning to be even more offensive in her views on the matter, comparing the events described in the lyrics of Rule, Britannia! to Nazis singing about gas chambers.

According to newspaper Expressen, the two boys were subjected to rape and torture from the hours of 11 pm on Saturday night to around 9 am the following morning.

Both of the suspects were arrested shortly after the boys were found and police told newspaper Aftonbladet that the boys may have been randomly targetted for the abuse.

Police even claimed the migrant-background pair threatened to bury the boys alive at one point and stabbed each of them in the leg. The 18-year-old has since been released on remand while the 21-year-old remains in police custody. Both have denied the crimes.

Habte Araya, 41, stands accused of pushing the eight-year-old boy and his mother onto the tracks in an apparently random attack at Frankfurt’s main station in July 2019.

The mother was able to roll off the tracks to avoid the oncoming high-speed InterCity Express train, but the boy was killed instantly.

Araya, who had entered Germany from Switzerland days earlier, is also accused of trying to push a 78-year-old woman onto the tracks, though she managed to save herself.

The attack stunned Germany and stoked a heated debate on immigration and security.

A psychiatric expert who examined Araya told the district court in Frankfurt on Thursday that the suspect was experiencing an episode of paranoid schizophrenia at the time and continues to suffer from a “pathological mental disorder”.

He said Araya could not be held criminally responsible for his actions and still posed a danger to the public.

The expert recommended that Araya be placed long term in a secure psychiatric facility.

Prosecutors and Araya’s own defence team supported the recommendation in their closing arguments.

Prosecutors have said they believe Araya had “at least a considerably reduced ability” to control his actions.

– ‘Infinitely sorry’ –

Araya apologised in a written statement read by his lawyer at the opening of the trial on August 19.

“I am infinitely sorry, especially for the family,” he said, admitting that the crime “must have happened according to all the information I have received”, though he could not remember it.

The tragic case led the far-right AfD party to call for tighter controls on foreigners entering Germany, although the suspect was not in the country illegally.

“Protect the citizens of our country at long last,” the anti-migration party’s parliamentary group leader Alice Weidel tweeted.

Conservative Interior Minister Horst Seehofer also saw the case as an occasion to take a tougher line on immigration, suggesting more extensive screening and “occasional temporary checks” at borders.

– Married father of three –

A married father of three, Araya had been living in Switzerland and was on the run from Swiss police after a violent incident the previous week.

He had threatened a neighbour with a knife and locked her up, and also trapped his wife and their children, aged one, three and four, in their flat before running away.

Police said it appeared the suspect had not been listed as wanted in European police databases and had been able to cross borders freely.

Araya had been living in Switzerland since 2006 and was granted asylum in 2008.

According to the Bild newspaper, he had worked for a local transport company and was described by authorities as “an example of successful integration”.

He was even featured in a campaign by Swiss authorities to promote positive integration.",Immigrant Who Threw Child Under Train Faces Court Verdict,fake

The 31-year-old Syrian migrant confessed to several crimes while in police custody, including attacks on the Graz synagogue and attacking the president of the local Jewish community Elie Rosen with a chair leg.

He also explained his motivation to investigators saying that he hated Jews, homosexuality and claimed that homosexual acts are against his Islamic faith, newspaper OE24 reports.

The man is also alleged to have attacked a local gay and lesbian club in the city, throwing rocks at it.

As a result of the charges against him, the Federal Office for Foreign Affairs has begun the procedure to remove his asylum status.

Investigators have also raided the man’s apartment and confiscated various electronic devices and suspect that the Syrian may be tied to radical Islamic terrorist groups, according to Austrian Interior Minister Karl Nehammer.

The attack on the Graz synagogue took place earlier this month and saw the historic place of worship, which had been rebuilt after being demolished by the Nazis on Kristallnacht in 1938, defaced with pro-Palestinian graffiti.

“The situation has deteriorated considerably over the last five years, especially in the last two or three, the situation has deteriorated very much,” Mr Rosen commented earlier this year.

Graz has been a “stronghold” for radical Islam for years, and according to a 2017 report, over half of the mosques in the city were linked to the preaching of radical Islamic theology.

Antisemitic attacks have surged in recent years across Europe, which some have blamed on the high levels of mass migration since the height of the migrant crisis in 2015.

Hungarian MEP Balázs Hidvéghi made this point earlier this year saying, “While all such attacks must be firmly condemned and rejected, it must also be talked about that the emergence and spread of radical Muslim antisemitism in Europe contributes to the rise of anti-Semitic attacks.”

Dozens, sometimes hundreds of illegal migrants have been crossing the English Channel from France in small boats in recent months, with none being turned back by the Border Force, very few being turned back by the French authorities, and only a small minority being deported at a later date.

This is in spite of the fact that virtually all of them have no legal right to asylum in Britain, as they are arriving in the country from a safe, first world EU member-state, and have usually passed through multiple safe countries prior to that as well.

Priti Patel’s Home Office — the British government department responsible for border control, policing, and national security — had blamed this state of affairs on the work of “activist lawyers” taking advantage of “regulations [which] are rigid and open to abuse” to “delay and disrupt returns” — an accusation buttressed by new revelations that lawyers have managed to spring every single migrant from a planned return flight to Spain.

Just One in 40 Illegal Channel Migrants Returned to EU: Report https://t.co/fR1uTu23rc — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) August 8, 2020

“[T]here was 100 per cent legal attrition rate on the flight due to unprecedented and organised casework barriers sprung on the government by three law firms,” an anonymous Whitehall source told The Sun, naming Duncan Lewis, John Street, and Milestone Solicitors as the firms which had managed to “bog the process down in legal quagmire” on behalf of the 23 migrants.

“The Government’s efforts to facilitate entirely legitimate and legal returns of people who have entered the UK through illegal routes are too often frustrated by last-minute challenges submitted hours before a scheduled flight,” a Home Office spokesman confirmed in an official statement.

“These claims are very often baseless and entirely without merit, but are given full legal consideration, leading to removal being rescheduled. This can effectively result in the timing out of a return due to stringent Dublin Regulations,” they added, referring to the EU asylum rules Britain is still obliged to follow while the post-Brexit “transition” period is ongoing.

Report: Two Border Force Ships Sitting Idle as Migrant Boats Surge Across Channel https://t.co/8yJqV7Lacf — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) August 24, 2020

Migration sceptics have become increasingly frustrated with the Conservative government’s complaints about its supposed inability to get on top of illegal immigration in general and the Channel crisis in particular, however, given the issues they describe have existed since the came to office under David Cameron all the way back in 2010.

Even in the case of boat crossings, which have only become the most-reported means by which migrants enter Britain illegally relatively recently, Priti Patel’s predecessor Sajid Javid declared them a “major incident” in December 2018 — to absolutely no effect, given they have continued to increase to now unprecedented numbers.

The notionally right-wing party may have had some excuse for failing to act when they were forced to govern alongside the Liberal Democrats, or when David Cameron, Theresa May, and Boris Johnson had only slim parliamentary majorities or minority administrations — but this has not been the case since December 2019, when Johnson won a very substantial 80-seat majority.

While there may be some merit to the arguments that lawyers are abusing the legal system, whether for activist purposes or simply to rake in more money, and that judges are offering somewhat dubious interpretations of the law in order to prevent deportations — for example, a Scottish judge recently stirred controversy by blocking the deportation of a Taliban fighter who had already lost six appeals because his PTSD care in Afghanistan would be inferior to his free treatment in he the United Kingdom — the Prime Minister could make use of his parliamentary majority to change the law at any time.

However, by saying that “Soon we will no longer be bound by EU laws and can negotiate our own return arrangements” in its “activist lawyers” tweet, the Home Office appeared to suggest it has no intention of pushing for any legislative action until at least 2021, while the Channel crisis continues to intensify.

Even in 2021, the government may continue to be bound by a myriad of British and European human rights law — Britain’s relationship with the European Court of Human Rights was not terminated by Brexit, as it is technically not an EU institution — and by an anti-borders interpretation of international maritime law.

Despite the fact the latter is non-binding, it has been used to justify the failure of UK Border Force to turn back illegal migrants intercepted at sea, with the government claiming it is required to simply pick them up and bring them the rest of the way to Britain — even though Australia has turned migrant boats around with great success for years now.

Home Office Has ‘No Idea’ How Many Illegal Migrants are in the UK https://t.co/R4CgwUCipn — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) June 17, 2020

Some indication of the government’s apparent lack of will on these issues is given by the fact that the “activist lawyers” tweet has now been deleted, following outcry from lawyers’ lobbies suggesting that criticism of their profession or of judicial decisions amounts to an attack on the rule of law.

Matthew Rycroft, the Home Office’s Permanent Secretary, declared that the “activist lawyers” phrase “should not have been used on an official government channel”, adding that he had “made clear to the team this post should not be used again from Home Office accounts or anywhere else by civil servants.”

A source speaking to The Times apparently said that Patel, Rycroft’s democratically-elected boss, at least in theory, “was familiar with the language used and did not think that it was wrong” — but went no further than that, which perhaps suggests either she or the Prime Minister do not have the stomach for a direct confrontation with the permanent bureaucracy or the legal profession.

On June 2, according to police, Dorn was guarding Lee’s Pawn and Jewelry in St. Louis as riots, fires, and looting broke out. Surveillance footage, police said, shows Dorn arriving at the pawn shop, which had already been looted by 24-year-old convicted felon Stephan Cannon and other men.

That is when Cannon can allegedly be seen on the footage approaching the corner of the pawn shop with a gun, and it is at this time that Dorn was shot, killed, and left on the sidewalk bleeding.

Dorn’s murder was live-streamed on Facebook.

“As I slept, looters were ransacking the shop,” Dorn said:

They shot and killed Dave in cold blood and livestreamed the execution and his last moments on this earth. Dave’s grandson was watching the video on Facebook in real time, not realizing he was watching his own grandfather dying on the sidewalk. I learned of all this around 4:00 am when our doorbell rang. The Chief of Police was standing outside. I wondered why Dave had not answered the door. It wasn’t uncommon for him to be up watching TV at that time. I called out to him several times. No reply. He wasn’t there. I let in the Chief. Fighting back tears, he uttered the words every officer’s spouse dreads. I re-live that horror in my mind every single day. My hope is that having you re-live it with me now will help shake this country from the nightmare we are witnessing in our cities and bring about positive, peaceful change.

Dorn thanked President Trump for his commitment to aiding local communities in restoring law and order.

“President Trump … has offered federal help to restore order in our communities,” Dorn said. “In a time when police departments are short on resources and manpower, we need that help. We should accept that help. We must heal before we can effect change, but we cannot heal amid devastation and chaos.”

“President Trump knows we need more Davids in our communities, not fewer,” Dorn said.

“As we come to light, our country is facing trouble,” Graham continued. “Tens of thousands are in a path of a deadly storm. The pandemic has driven millions of hearts with fear. We are divided … Anger and despair have floated to the streets. We need your help. We need to hear your voice at this crucial hour. We ask that you unite our hearts, to be one nation under God, for you are our only hope.”

During his speech, Graham took a moment to “thank” God for President Trump, praying for his safety and guidance.

Dorn said her husband loved kids and had befriended a young man named Lee when he was just a kid after members of his family were attacked and murdered. Lee eventually opened up a pawn shop, and her husband would help him with security.

She said whenever the shop’s alarm would go off, the alarm company would call Dave, and he would investigate. She said if he got a call after she went to bed, he would wake her up to tell her he was going to Lee’s shop to make sure everything was alright.

She said most of the time, they were false alarms triggered by storms or animals. Still, she said she never rested easily until she heard his key turn to unlock the door.

But, she said, “The alarm that went off the morning of June 2nd was for real.”

She said she was “keenly” aware of the rioting and as the Officer Wellness and CIT Coordinator with the police department, she had spent the evening getting ready to mobilize support efforts for officers who were impacted.

After she went to bed that night, she said her husband received a call from Lee’s alarm company — the front door of the pawn shop had been breached.

This time, Dorn did not wake her up to tell her he was leaving as she would have tried to stop him or insisted on going with him.

“They shot and killed Dave in cold blood and live-streamed the execution and his last moments on this earth. Dave’s grandson was watching the video on Facebook in real time, not realizing he was watching his own grandfather dying on the sidewalk,” she said.

She said, at 4 a.m., her doorbell rang and the chief of police was standing outside.

“I wondered why Dave had not answered the door,” she said. “It wasn’t uncommon for him to be up watching TV at that time. I called out to him several times. No reply. He wasn’t there. I let in the chief.”

She said he was fighting back tears when he uttered the words every officer’s spouse dreads.

“I relive that horror in my mind every single day,” she said.

“My hope is that having you relive it with me now will help shake this country from the nightmare we are witnessing in our cities and bring about positive, peaceful change,” she said. “How did we get to this point where so many young people are so callous and indifferent towards human life? This isn’t a video game where you can commit mayhem and then hit ‘reset’ and bring all the characters back to life,” she said.

Dorn condemned the violent riots engulfing the country.

“David is never coming back. He was murdered by people who didn’t know and didn’t care that he would have done anything to help them. Violence and destruction are not legitimate forms of protest. They do not safeguard black lives. They destroy them,” she said.

“President Trump understands this and has offered federal help to restore order in our communities. In a time when police departments are short on resources and manpower, we need that help. We should accept that help,” she said.

Mueller was held captive, tortured, and “raped repeatedly” by the vicious group’s late leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.

Former “President Obama refused to meet with us until ISIS had already beheaded other Americans,” Carl Mueller proclaimed at the RNC. “To this day, we’ve never heard from [then-Vice President] Joe Biden.”

Democrat presidential nominee Biden’s loss of his first wife, young daughter, and his eldest son has become central to his political persona. The presidential candidate, along with his Democrat colleagues and their mainstream media allies, often tout the tragedy that has shaped his life as a point of connection to those who need help overcoming similar hardships such as the Mueller family. The media has praised the former VP for consoling those who need help overcoming surmounting loss.

Carl and Marsha Mueller stressed that President Barack Obama and his administration could have been heroes and rescued their daughter, but chose not to.

“We endured an agonizing back-and-forth between us, the Obama administration, and ISIS. We put all our faith in the government. But the government let us down,” Carl said, adding:

The Obama administration hid behind policy so much that we felt hopeless when they kept us from negotiating to save Kayla’s life. … The military prepared a rescue mission, but the [Obama] White House delayed it. By the time it went forward, Kayla had been moved to a different location.

U.S. President Donald Trump named the operation that led to the October 2019 demise of the “whimpering and crying and screaming,” as Trump described him, “caliph” Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in honor of Kayla. ISIS kidnapped Kayla while she was working as a humanitarian in northern Syria in 2013. In 2015, U.S. officials confirmed the death of then-26-year-old Kayla.

“The Trump team gave us empathy we never received from the Obama administration,” her parents said at the RNC, adding, “If Donald Trump had been President when Kayla was captured, she would be here today.”

Under Trump, the U.S. has helped secure the release of a record number of Americans (over 20), including three children born in captivity to an American woman and her Canadian husband held by the Afghan Taliban and al-Qaeda-linked Haqqani Network.

The Muellers had previously said the Obama administration threatened them with criminal prosecution for potentially violating a U.S. policy against negotiating with terrorists when they attempted to pay ISIS a ransom for their daughter’s release.

Obama’s Pentagon conceded that the U.S. government does “on occasion,” pay U.S. taxpayer money “to obtain information” on American hostages.

A few months after Kayla’s 2015 death, Obama changed the policy against negotiating with hostage-takers, admitting the government had failed families of American captives. However, he refused to change the measure prohibiting the paying of ransoms to terrorist groups.

Before the alleged policy overhaul, President Obama did not hesitate to carry out failed peace talks with Afghan Taliban narco-terrorists. After the changes, he paid the world’s leading state sponsor of terror Iran $400 million in cash described by some Republicans as “ransom” to release hostages.

Obama negotiated the 2014 exchange of five high-level Taliban prisoners held at the Guantánamo Bay prison for the now-convicted U.S. Army deserter Bowe Bergdahl while refusing to allow Kayla’s family to pay a ransom for her release.

“The administration showed more concern for the terrorists in Guantanamo than for the American hostages in Syria,” Carl Mueller said at the RNC.

In 2015, a House panel determined that some of the Taliban jihadis released in exchange for Bergdahl had reengaged in “threatening activities.”

The Obama administration denied GOP allegations that before the prisoner swap, it paid a Taliban and al-Qaeda ally, the Haqqani Network, ransom money that failed to produce Bergdahl.

Islamic State terrorists abducted Carl and Marsha Mueller’s daughter in 2013 while she was in Syria working with the humanitarian aid group Doctors Without Borders, which the Muellers have criticized for not doing enough to help bring Kayla back. Upon being abducted and identified as a Westerner, ISIS jihadists placed Kayla into slavery. She became the property of Abu Sayyaf and wife Umm Sayyaf (“Umm” a common pseudonym for women jihadists meaning “mother”), where the “caliph” of the terrorist group, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, raped and tortured her.

A U.S. military raid in October resulted in al-Baghdadi’s death. Cornered by a military canine, al-Baghdadi detonated a suicide bomb, killing himself and three of his children.

“He died like a dog, he died like a coward,” President Donald Trump said at the time. “The world is now a much safer place.”

The mission to capture al-Baghdadi was named after Kayla.

Kayla Mueller is believed to have died in Raqqa, Syria – the “capital” of the Islamic State caliphate – in February 2015. ISIS terrorists claimed that a Jordanian airstrike targeting al-Baghdadi killed her, but have never presented any evidence corroborating that claim.

The Muellers recalled their daughter as “amazing,” with “a gift to be able to see the world through someone else’s eyes.” Marsha Mueller noted that Kayla’s existence was a sort of miracle, as doctors had told the couple they likely could not have conceived her.

They noted that her gift of empathy took her to Syria, where she was abducted and, they said, largely ignored by the incumbent Obama administration.

“Kayla was mostly held in a 12’ by 12’ cell in solitary confinement. It was cold and dirty. ISIS terrorists shined bright lights in her face. They shaved her head. They beat her and tortured her,” father Carl Mueller detailed. “The leader of ISIS, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, raped her repeatedly. For 18 months, she endured. And we endured an agonizing back-and-forth between us, the Obama administration, and ISIS.”

“We put all our faith in the government. But our government let us down,” Carl Mueller lamented.

Carl Mueller then accused the Obama White House of delaying a mission that could have rescued his daughter and placing very little importance on the case.

“President Obama refused to meet with us until ISIS had already beheaded other Americans. To this day, we’ve never heard from Joe Biden,” Carl Mueller said. “Instead, the Obama administration hid behind policy so much that we felt hopeless when they kept us from negotiating to save Kayla’s life.”

“The administration showed more concern for the terrorists in Guantanamo than for the American hostages in Syria,” Carl noted pointedly. “The Obama administration kept telling us they were doing everything they could. But their version of ‘everything’ wasn’t enough. What a difference a president makes.”

Both Muellers wholeheartedly endorsed Trump.

“The Trump team gave us empathy we never received from the Obama administration. The Obama administration said it was doing everything it could. The Trump administration actually is,” Carl Mueller said.

“Let me just say this: Kayla should be here. If Donald Trump had been President when Kayla was captured, she would be here today,” Carl affirmed.

“Carl and I support Donald Trump because of his commitment to make and keep America great, not with the power of the government, but with the passion of people like Kayla — Americans who, even in the darkest days, always have more fight left inside of them,” Marsha Mueller said. “Americans who don’t just talk — they act. That was our daughter. That’s President Trump. As long as we stay strong like Kayla, as long as we refuse to break, we will be great.”

Marsha Mueller, while her husband held up a photo of Kayla, read a letter retrieved after her death from Syria that Kayla had written in captivity, highlighting the intensity of her faith.

“I have been shown in darkness, light and have learned that even in prison, one can be free. I am grateful … I have had many hours to think how only in your absence have I finally at 25 years old come to realize your place in my life,” Kayla wrote. “None of us could have known it would be this long but know I am also fighting from my side in the ways I am able and I have a lot of fight left inside of me … I am not breaking down and I will not give in no matter how long it takes.”

Kayla Mueller was held for a time by Islamic State financier Abu Sayyaf and his wife Umm Sayyaf. Abu Sayyaf was killed in a 2015 raid, while Umm Sayyaf (real name Nasrin As’ad Ibrahim) was taken alive and charged by the FBI with imprisoning and torturing Mueller. According to the FBI affidavit, Mueller was personally raped by al-Baghdadi, who referred to her as his “wife,” while in the Sayyafs’ custody. Witnesses who knew Mueller in her captivity say she endured being al-Baghdadi’s sex slave as well as other torture, such as having her fingernails ripped out, in an attempt to get her to convert to Islam. Witnesses have affirmed her refusal to renounce her Christian faith.

Both Umm Sayyaf, captured by Kurdish fighters in 2015, and escaped ISIS sex slaves spoke highly of Kayla in custody, describing her as resolute and concerned about the wellbeing of the other women in captivity. Islamic State terrorists regularly abducted girls and women throughout Iraq and Syria to use in sex slavery, particularly non-Arab Muslim girls from Christian and Yazidi communities.

“She was a lovely girl and I liked her. She was very respectful and I respected her. One thing I would say is she was very good at hiding her sadness and pain,” Umm Sayyaf said in June 2019.

A teen Yazidi girl who endured sex slavery and knew Kayla Mueller in captivity said in 2015 that, when she and other Yazidis escaped, they tried to convince Mueller to flee with them, but she said that, as she was clearing an American white woman, she would be conspicuous and endanger their escape, so she stayed.

Under the Trump administration, a combined effort between the U.S. military and the largely Kurdish Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) brought down ISIS is Raqqa, its capital, ending the physical “caliphate” in 2017. ISIS in the Middle East is largely defeated, organizing sporadic attacks against Kurdish forces and largely relegated to Kurdish prisons. Many Islamic State terrorists fled abroad, making the group far stronger in places like Nigeria and the Philippines.

535,http://www.breitbart.com/asia/2020/08/28/hong-kong-pressures-kindergartens-adopt-chinese-national-identity-propaganda/,2020-08-28T00:00:00,breitbart,"Hong Kong’s Education Secretary Kevin Yeung sent a letter to the city’s pre-schools urging them to pressure kindergartners to embrace Chinese “national identity,” the local broadcaster RTHK reported Friday.

Yeung’s letter followed over a year of protests against China’s increasingly brazen violations of the autonomy of Hong Kong. Under the “one country, two systems” policy adopted after the United Kingdom gave Hong Kong up in 1997, the Communist Party has no authority to impose laws on Hong Kong. In turn, Hong Kong cannot declare sovereignty or act as a state. Yet dictator Xi Jinping has increasingly attempted to impose repressive communist laws on the state, first through a legislative bill allowing the extradition of anyone present in Hong Kong to China.

When protests caused the bill to fail in the Legislative Council, Beijing’s National People’s Congress illegally passed a “national security” law granting the Communist Party the ability to imprison someone for a minimum of ten years for crimes such as “secession” and “subversion of state power.” The law effectively does what the extradition bill would have — allow China to imprison anyone in Hong Kong in the Communist Party system.

The attempt to impose the extradition bill launched some of the biggest protests in the history of the city, attracting at their peak two million of Hong Kong’s 7 million people. The protests aligned with a historic drop in the number of people who identify as Chinese or openly express fealty to Beijing.

In light of that political and cultural rejection of communist China, Yeung urged those teaching young children to indoctrinate them into loyalty to the regime.

“In a letter sent to all pre-schools ahead of the start of a new school year, Yeung said teachers should take gradual steps towards helping young children build their Chinese identity,” RTHK reported, “and understand the Chinese culture like filial piety through activities like story telling and singing of nursery rhymes.”

“In a separate letter to all primary and secondary schools,” RTHK detailed, “the education chief called on teachers to serve as role models and teach students how to express themselves in a peaceful, legal and rational manner, while respecting the views of other people.”

Yeung has been at the forefront of pro-China Chief Executive Carrie Lam’s efforts to ensure that younger Hongkongers do not rebel as loudly against communism as those who are young adults today. In July, Yeung warned schools not to allow anyone to sing “political” songs, meaning the many protest anthems that have become popular among anti-communists.

“No one, including students, should play, sing, and broadcast songs which contain political messages or hold any activities to express their political stance,” the education secretary wrote. Yeung specifically identified the unofficial anthem of the protests, “Glory to Hong Kong” as a problematic song because it was linked to “violent and illegal acts.”

The Chinese Communist Party has spent months attempting to frame the Hong Kong protest movement as senseless violence perpetrated by thugs, going as far as to compare riots in the United States perpetrated by leftists ideologically aligned with China to the anti-communist Hong Kong protesters. While violence has occurred at protests in Hong Kong, it has largely been at the hands of police and pro-China thugs with ties to the “triad” organized crime syndicates that inhabit the city.

In June, Yeung explicitly told school administrators to punish “dangerous and unlawful” activities in the aftermath of the passage of the “national security” law. Yeung defined “violent” behavior as “chanting slogans, forming human chains, and posting slogans or singing songs which contain political messages.”

The “national security” law bans four alleged “crimes” in Hong Kong: incitement to foreign interference, acts of secession, “subversion of state power,” and “terrorism,” failing to offer specific elements of any of the four crimes. Anyone found guilty of one of these crimes must serve a minimum of ten years in prison.

To prevent running afoul of the law, Hong Kong schools and libraries have begun censoring their book collections, screening books for anything that can be interpreted in any way as a violation. For context on how broad the law’s mandate is, police arrested a man under the “national security” law in July for wearing a Liverpool soccer shirt, claiming that wearing anything British was a clear call for “foreign interference.”

Yeung’s Education Bureau told teachers and librarians in July to do away with “outraged content or content that may concern the four aforementioned offenses.” The result of the mandate was that many books not of a clear political character also disappeared from access for students while administrators reviewed them.

On Tuesday, a group of Hong Kong teachers sent a letter to Yeung urging an end to censorship of any books or other education materials that have a valid place in their curricula.

“We express our strong dissatisfaction and request the Education Bureau to withdraw the political review and deletion of general education textbooks,” the letter asserted. “Not only is it completely inconsistent with the Education Bureau’s claims of ‘improving the quality of textbooks’ and ‘implementing the aims and objectives of the curriculum,’ it is more apparent that political censorship is introduced through so-called ‘consultation’ to control the content of general education textbooks and implement brainwashing education for students.”

Trump described the stark difference between his education policy and that of what is planned by Biden and the Democrat Party, who are supported by teachers’ unions.

“Biden … vowed to oppose school choice and close down charter schools, ripping away the ladder of opportunity for black and Hispanic children,” the president said, adding:

In a second term, I will expand charter schools and provide school choice to every family in America, and we will always treat our teachers with the tremendous respect they deserve.

Trump also observed that “Joe Biden is weak”:

He takes his marching orders from liberal hypocrites who drive their cities into the ground while fleeing far from the scene of the wreckage. These same liberals want to eliminate school choice while they enroll their children in the finest private schools in the land.

The president has consistently supported education opportunity for every child.

In his State of the Union address in February, he said an “inclusive society” is one that ensures “every young American gets a great education.”

“[F]or too long, countless American children have been trapped in failing government schools,” he said. “To rescue these students, 18 states have created school choice in the form of Opportunity Scholarships. The programs are so popular, that tens of thousands of students remain on waiting lists.”

The president has urged Congress to pass legislation that would ensure education opportunities for students by providing a federal tax credit to individuals and businesses that donate to nonprofit scholarship funds.

In November 2019, Florida Angel Mom Kiyan Michael, a member of the Black Voices for Trump advisory board, drew attention to the divide between the Democrat Party and black voters on the issue of school choice.

In a column at the Sun-Sentinel, Michael wrote that school choice programs, such as those Republicans in her state have been putting into effect since the early 2000s, have been a successful way to pull low-income children out of failing public schools.

Moreover, black Democrats have been overwhelmingly supportive of school choice, though most party leaders and 2020 Democrat presidential candidates are not, favoring their relationships with teachers’ unions instead.

Michael observed one national poll, commissioned by the American Federation for Children, which advocates for school choice, that found 67 percent of voters support school choice, including 73 percent of Latinos, 67 percent of blacks, and 68 percent of whites.

Another poll released in August 2019 by Education Next found black Democrats approve of targeted vouchers, universal vouchers, and charter schools at 70 percent, 64 percent, and 55 percent, respectively, and Hispanic Democrats approve at 67 percent, 60 percent, and 47 percent.

Yet a third poll commissioned by school choice proponents Democrats for Education Reform, found 81 percent of Democrat primary voters, including 89 percent of black Democrat primary voters, support a proposal to “expand access to more choices and options within the public-school system,” including charter schools, which are funded with taxpayer dollars but operated by private boards.

Despite these overwhelming numbers in support of school choice in its many forms, Michael observed, “Do-nothing Democrats still call the policy racist because they’d rather that public school teachers win with lifetime employment while black children lose with a lifetime of underperformance and missed dreams.”",Trump: Biden Agenda ‘Ripping Away Ladder of Opportunity for Black and Hispanic Children’,fake

One professor went so far as to label Trump as the school’s “worst admissions mistake.” In a recent book, Trump’s niece made the claim that the president hired an expert to take his SAT exam in his place. This week, the university rejected calls to investigate the president’s college entrance exam, citing the impracticality of the task.

According to a student newspaper report, professors at the University of Pennsylvania are demanding an investigation into the claim that President Donald Trump cheated on the SAT college entrance exam in 1963. The president’s niece, Mary Trump, claimed in her recent book that the president hired an expert to take his SAT exam prior to his admission to Penn’s Wharton School in the 1960s.

“Concerns about cheating are exacerbated when the alleged perpetrator is a public figure in high office,” the professors wrote. “Failing to investigate an allegation of fraud at such a level broadcasts to prospective students and the world at large that the playing field is not equal, that our degrees can be bought, and that subsequent fame, wealth, and political status will excuse past misconduct.”

University of Pennsylvania business professor Eric Orts argues that admitting President Trump to the university was the “worst admissions mistake” the school has made. Orts suggested that the university can redeem itself it if can prove that the president cheated on his SAT exam.

“In my personal opinion, Donald Trump is the worst admissions mistake that the Wharton School has ever made,” Orts said. “Now it turns out that we may not have made a mistake after all: we may well have been just another victim among many who have had their reputations besmirched by his lifelong pattern of deception and fraud.”

This week, University of Pennsylvania Provost Wendell Pritchett rejected calls for an investigation. Pritchett claims that it would impractical to investigate an event that occurred several decades ago.

“We certainly share your concerns about these allegations and the integrity of our admissions process,” Pritchett wrote. “However, as you suggest in your message, we have determined that this situation occurred too far in the past to make a useful or probative factual inquiry possible. If new evidence surfaces to substantiate the claim in the future, we will continue to be open to investigating it.”

Rudy Giuliani had hard words for former Obama administration Vice President and Democrat presidential nominee Joe Biden on Thursday night, as he made his speech during the final night of the 2020 Republican National Convention. After speaking of the Big Apple’s decline from his tenure as NYC mayor through today’s governance by Bill de Blasio, Giuliani made the case that “all black lives matter” to the Republican party.

That is when he turned his sights on Joe Biden. “The Democrats are urging you to vote for an obviously defective candidate,” he stated. “Biden has changed his principles so often, he no longer has any principles.”

“He’s a trojan horse with Bernie, AOC, Pelosi, Black Lives Matter, and his party’s entire left wing, just waiting to execute their pro-criminal, anti-police, socialist policies,” Giuliani warned.

“These continuous riots in Democratic cities give you a good view of the future under Biden,” Giuliani said. “All five of the top cities for homicides, like the top cities for rioting and looting, are governed by ‘progressive’ Democrats.”

You think the progressive Democrat approach to crime — which is to do nothing substantive to reduce it; to release prisoners — as many and as soon as possible, and to go to war with the police — the only group with the capability to protect your citizens!

“It is clear that a vote for Biden and the Democrats creates the risk that you will bring this lawlessness to your city, to your town, to your suburb,” Giuliani asserted. “There is no question that this awesome job of restoring safety for our people cannot be done from your basement, Joe!”

“There’s also no question that President Trump will fight with all his strength to preserve the American system of government, and our way of life,” he concluded. “President Trump with his boundless love of our country and all our people, his disciplined work ethic, his exceptional ability to inspire, and his deep understanding of our system of government and the strength of American values, is the man we can trust to preserve — and even improve — our way of life.”

“Joe Biden would return us to a weak and dangerous past. Barack Obama’s own secretary of defense said Joe Biden has been wrong on nearly every major national security decision over the past four decades,” he said before comparing the two candidates’ records.

“Joe Biden slashed defense spending again and again. President Trump rebuilt our military—and added the Space Force,” he said.

“Joe Biden let ISIS terrorists rampage across the Middle East. President Trump eliminated ISIS’s leader—and destroyed its caliphate,” Cotton said.

“Joe Biden opposed the mission to kill Osama bin Laden. President Trump avenged the murder of hundreds of Americans by killing Iran’s terrorist mastermind, Qassim Soleimani,” he continued.

“Joe Biden sent pallets of cash to the ayatollahs. President Trump ripped up the dangerous Iran nuclear deal.”

Cotton accused Biden of coddling “socialist dictators in Cuba and Venezuela” while “President Trump fights against communism—in America’s backyard and around the world.”

The Arkansas senator then zeroed in on China.

“Joe Biden aided and abetted China’s rise for fifty years with terrible trade deals that closed our factories and laid off our workers. President Trump stands up to China’s cheating, and stealing, and lying,” Cotton said.

“Joe Biden allowed Chinese fentanyl to flood across our southern border. President Trump sanctioned Chinese drug dealers for poisoning our kids,” he said.

“Joe Biden said the Chinese Communists aren’t even our competitors, aren’t “bad folks”—just months before they unleashed this plague on the world. President Trump is clear-eyed about the Chinese threat, and he’s making China pay,” Cotton said.

“But China’s not giving up—in fact, they’re rooting for Joe Biden. America’s other enemies won’t give up either. But Joe Biden would be as wrong and weak over the next four years as he has been for the last fifty,” he added.

“We need a president who stands up for America—not one who takes a knee,” Cotton said.

Flood said:

My name is Debbie Flood and I own a small foundry and machine shop in Wisconsin that manufactures cast bronze architectural hardware. My father, a WWII veteran, started the business with some used equipment and the American dream. Today, we are one of the only U.S. companies left who make our products from start to finish under one roof. We really make things and we love it.

Flood continued:

When we lost nearly 50% of our business to China in the mid-2000s, we wondered how a small company like ours could continue to compete. At the time, Joe Biden was a senator. He voted to normalize trade with China and helped pave the way for them to join the WTO, even though they were hurting American companies like ours. [Emphasis added] … Later, we fought our way through the Great Recession. Then Donald Trump was elected, and we breathed a sigh of relief. He actually fought for American workers and American craftsmen. He actually cared about bringing back those three beautiful words, “Made in America.” We no longer had to succeed despite government. Now, the government was on our side, and we enjoyed a thriving economy stimulated by President Trump’s pro-business and pro-worker policies. Thanks to the Trump tax cuts, I‘ve been able to raise my employees’ wages. [Emphasis added]

Indeed, Biden voted to normalize U.S. trade relations with China, supported their entering the WTO, and has downplayed the economic threat of China to American sovereignty and American businesses.

Most recently, Biden said he would end Trump’s tariffs on billions of dollars worth of China-made goods before his aides walked the statement back. Likewise, in 2019, Biden criticized Trump’s tariffs on China.

As Breitbart News has chronicled, decades-long free trade deals, NAFTA, and China’s entering the WTO eliminated nearly five million manufacturing jobs across the country since 1994. Free trade advocates, like Biden, claimed at the time that NAFTA would create a million U.S. manufacturing jobs in the first five years.

In her “fact check” of Pence’s address at the Republican National Convention (RNC) on Wednesday night, Timm wrote, “Elective abortions do not occur ‘up until the moment of birth.'”

“Just 1.2 percent occur after 21 weeks of gestation, according to the latest data,” she added.

“Apparently, the Democrats’ only solution for their platform’s unpopularity is to say the other side is lying about it,” Tony Perkins, president of Family Research Council Action, wrote Thursday.

Observing Timm’s “fact check,” Perkins added, “NBC didn’t just stop with calling [Pence’s statement] false — but the entire notion of late-term abortion!”

The family and faith leader continued that Timm’s claim “elective abortions do not occur ‘up until the moment of birth’ is a lie so outrageous you have to wonder how the media manages even 13 percent credibility in this country.”

He explained:

Believe it or not, 22 states — almost half — allow birth day abortion. And in seven of those, women don’t need a reason. A pregnant mom at 39 weeks can literally walk into a willing clinic and ask for an abortion, no questions asked. This is what liberals mean when they talk about “codifying” Roe v. Wade. Democrats know better than anyone that the default effect of that ruling was making abortion legal through all nine months. The only reason there are any restrictions at all on late-term abortion is because certain states took it upon themselves to enact them.

The abortion industry and its political and media allies created the narrative that elective, later-term abortions only occur when the mother’s life is in danger or a fetal anomaly is discovered.

During the 2016 presidential race, failed Democrat nominee Hillary Clinton brought the same false claim forward once again.

The problem with the claim is that abortionists themselves have been saying it is false for decades.

According to a 1997 report in the Los Angeles Times, Ron Fitzsimmons, former executive director of the National Coalition of Abortion Providers, admitted partial birth abortions were not that rare.

“The abortion rights folks know it, the anti-abortion folks know it and so, probably, does everyone else,” Fitzsimmons said, adding that he “lied through [his] teeth” during a Nightline interview when he said partial-birth abortions were rarely performed and only due to fetal anomalies and serious health risks to the mother.

""The majority of these procedures [late-term abortions] are performed… on healthy women and healthy fetuses."" – Ron Fitzsimmons, Director of the National Coalition of Abortion Providers https://t.co/S8IiG32gr9 — Lila Rose (@LilaGraceRose) February 6, 2019

Murdered abortionist George Tiller told National Abortion Federation attendees in 1995:

We have some experience with late terminations; about 10,000 patients between 24 and 36 weeks and something like 800 fetal anomalies between 26 and 36 weeks in the past 5 years.

“That equates to a mere eight percent of Tiller’s late-term patients who aborted because their babies were diagnosed prenatally with a health condition,” pro-life organization Live Action observed.

A study released in 2013 by the pro-abortion rights Guttmacher Institute also found that women who were seeking both first-trimester and late-term abortions provided the same reasons for delaying the procedure, including “not knowing about the pregnancy,” “trouble deciding about the abortion,” and “disagreeing about the abortion with the man involved.”

The study concluded that “most women seeking later terminations are not doing so for reasons of fetal anomaly or life endangerment.”

A 2018 report for the Congressional Research Service noted that Dr. Diana Greene Foster, professor at the University of California, San Francisco, said abortions for fetal anomaly “make up a small minority of later abortion” and that, due to inadequate data, those for endangerment to the life of the mother are even more difficult to describe.

Former Planned Parenthood President Dr. Leana Wen repeated the same falsehood about later-term abortions:

90% of abortions occur before 21 weeks. As a doctor & public health expert, I can tell you that those that occur later often result from a diagnosis of severe fetal abnormalities, or serious risks to the woman's health. — Leana Wen, M.D. (@DrLeanaWen) February 6, 2019

In late 2011, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported nearly 13,000 fully developed babies who would be able to survive outside the womb are aborted annually.

In June 2019, the Hill reported on a Harvard Center for American Political Studies (CAPS)/Harris poll that revealed only eight percent of Americans say abortion should be permitted until the third trimester of pregnancy.

Additionally, only six percent say abortion should be allowed “up until the birth of the child.”

Perkins wrote that, “amazingly,” Democrats want even more than abortion at the moment of birth:

Based on their voting record, they want “abortion” after birth too. Americans saw this for themselves with gut-wrenching clarity, when Joe Biden’s running mate, Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), was one of those 44 senators who marched to the floor and endorsed infanticide as a legitimate form of health care — not once, but twice. Now, six months later, the mainstream media wants to pretend none of this ever happened. But if abortion is “moral,” — nay, “sacred” as Nancy Pelosi said — why the sudden self-consciousness?

“It all boils down to one thing: the Democrats’ radicalism brings in the bucks — but not the ballots,” he concluded.

“Voters couldn’t be more turned off by ideas like tearing down the only wall between taxpayers and the abortion industry in the Hyde amendment,” Perkins said. “Or by the plan to pack the courts with Roe ideologues. Imagine how repulsed they’d be to know that the woman campaigning for America’s second most powerful job is on record fighting to let newborns die.”",NBC News: ‘Elective Abortions Do Not Occur Up Until Moment of Birth’,fake

He continued, “I have to say, in his delivery, again, I thought the president — who we have seen really turn on a crowd — was surprisingly flat and didn’t seem to have the bite that he usually does have in his speeches.”

Wallace added, “I agree with you. He laid out an ambitious plan for a second term, ten million jobs in ten months. Bringing medical supply chains back to the United States. Dealing with pre-existing conditions, though we have to point out he hasn’t done that in his first term.”

Borger said, “First of all, let me start, and following my colleagues about what they’ve been saying about the picture of this event, without masks, without distancing, and somehow, you’re sitting at home and you know what your life is like every day. You can’t go out without a mask. You are worried about whether your children can go to school. You may have lost your job. And with this occurring at the White House, as if it were an alternate universe, you have to sort of say, doesn’t this make people feel like their sacrifices have been for nothing? Are people worried that there is going to be some super-spreader event at the White House, perhaps?”

Host Anderson Cooper responded that Republicans will say that there were “huge, massive protests across the country over the course of the summer and people weren’t wearing masks, or even if they were.”

Borger responded, “Fine. This is on the lawn. This is on the lawn of the White House. And we can go over the question of whether it should have been there or should not have been there, but this is on the lawn of the White House. This is a president and a vice president who have a Coronavirus Task Force, which was not consulted about this event, as our reporting shows. So, you know, you have to have that picture.”

Maddow said, “I just keep thinking about people I know in my own life, who have elderly relatives, their moms, in most cases, the people I know, who are in congregate living places or in old folks’ homes, and they can’t physically be with them. And they have been — they have spent months now not making any physical contact with their elderly parents, afraid that they’re going to die from COVID or die from something else, and not have family with them. I keep thinking about the hospital workers who break down and tell us that the hardest thing in their lives is not being able to let family into the hospital to be with a dying loved one. Because they can’t because of coronavirus infection protocols. And I think about all the families that are suffering right now trying to figure out what the freak they are going to do about school and childcare. Because none of it makes sense, and there is no solution to it. And it is because we are all trying to stop the spread of coronavirus, and they just put 2,000 people at that White House event, not socially distanced, no masks, for hours, all screaming their guts out, packed together. And that is a danger, but it is also — it’s a kick in the teeth to every American who has sacrificed over the past six months to try to do their part to try to save lives in this country, to see what they did.”

VERDICT: True. A barrier of border agents, regulatory changes, and the steel-and-concrete wall have sharply dropped the cross-border flow of migrants, despite the massive economic pressure caused by the distant promise of decent jobs in the United States.

In his acceptance speech at the RNC, Trump declared:

Today, America’s borders are more secure than ever before. We ended catch-and-release, stopped asylum fraud, took down human traffickers who prey on women and children, and we have deported 20,000 gang members and 500,000 criminal aliens. We have already built 300 miles of border wall — and we are adding ten new miles every single week. The wall will soon be complete, and it is working beyond our wildest expectations.

The data is displayed by the Department of Homeland Security and show that the number of migrants at the border has been pushed down from 144,000 in May 2019 to 23,000 in 2020.

The reduced inflow of migrants has helped border officers block more drug trafficking. The Washington Times reported on August 23:

Ten months into the fiscal year (83.3% of the way to fiscal 2021), cocaine seizures are almost 96% of what they were in all of fiscal 2019, methamphetamine seizures 87.5% and (most significantly) fentanyl seizures are already at 198% of what they were in fiscal 2019.

The wall has played a subsidiary and complementary role compared to the many regulatory changes set by Trump. These changes include the Migrant Protection Protocols and the denial of work permits to asylum seekers.

Even the New York Times admitted on August 25:

The president has largely blocked asylum seekers and refugees fleeing persecution, war and violence. He has built nearly 300 miles of border wall … He has made it harder for poor people to immigrate to the United States, imposed travel bans on predominantly Muslim countries, and separated migrant children from their parents at the border.

However, Trump has yet to win permanent reductions in the legal migration or in the legal inflow of visa workers who are hired by Fortune 500 companies to take the jobs needed by Americans. The legal inflow of workers nudges down wages and boosts housing prices.",Fact Check: Trump Claims 'America's Borders Are More Secure',fake

VERDICT: True.

“When I learned that the Tennessee Valley Authority laid off hundreds of American workers and forced them to train their lower-paid foreign replacements, I promptly removed the Chairman of the Board,” Trump said. “And now, those talented American workers have been re-hired and are back providing power to Georgia, Alabama, Tennessee, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, and Virginia.”

“They have their old jobs back,” he said.

Trump recently took major action against the federally-owned Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) for their outsourcing plans whereby executives were laying off American employees but forcing them to train their foreign replacements beforehand.

After pressure from Trump and his firing of the chairman, Skip Thompson, TVA officials said they are dropping the outsourcing plans and reviewing CEO Jeff Lyash’s $8 million salary. The move garnered much support from the TVA union and advocates against outsourcing.

“This is why America elected Trump!” attorney John Miano said. The latest Reuters/Ipsos poll revealed that a majority of undecided voters support reducing immigration on the basis of protecting the jobs and wages of Americans.

VERDICT: MOSTLY TRUE. Solar and wind power are inadequate — but Biden has not dropped nuclear power.

President Donald Trump slammed rival Joe Biden’s support for eliminating fossil fuels, a core pledge in the former vice president’s platform for the 2020 election. With Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) advising his campaign on the “Biden-Sanders Unity Task Force,” Biden embraced a version of the “Green New Deal.” The major difference was that whereas Ocasio-Cortez wants to eliminate fossil fuels in the U.S. economy by 2030, Biden set the deadline at 2035.

Democrat-run California passed a law in 2018 requiring the state to achieve the goal of 100% “renewables” — chiefly solar and wind energy — by 2045.

But amidst rolling electricity blackouts in Northern California during a heat wave earlier this month, Gov. Gavin Newsom said that the state needed to “sober up” about the inadequacies of solar and wind energy, at least during the state’s “transition.” They could not meet high demand when the wind wasn’t blowing and the sun wasn’t shining.

Earlier this week, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti renewed his support for the city’s own “Green New Deal,” which means moving from natural gas to solar and wind power, even though officials have warned L.A. will struggle to keep the lights on.

The one saving grace of Biden’s platform is that he leaves room for “advanced nuclear [power] that eliminates risks associated with conventional nuclear technology,” also known as “fourth generation” nuclear power. (The Trump administration has also supported research into new nuclear technology.)

Without fossil fuels, nuclear power is the only way to meet an industrial economy’s energy needs. Unfortunately for Biden, it faces steep opposition within his own party.

The Intercept’s Lee Fang obtained letters from Republican lawmakers sent to the Acting DHS Secretary Chad Wolf in January and February asking that businesses be allowed to import thousands more foreign H-2B visa workers — months before joblessness jumped nearly fivefold to 33 million unemployed and nearly 11 million underemployed in April.

Republican Senators David Perdue (R-GA), Thom Tillis (R-NC), Bill Burr (R-NC), as well as 26 others previously noted by Breitbart News, sent letters to DHS claiming businesses needed additional foreign workers to hire because no Americans were available.

The List: 26 GOP Senators, 97 House Republicans Ask for More Foreign Workers to Fill U.S. Jobshttps://t.co/I1xQBE6mNZ — John Binder 👽 (@JxhnBinder) January 29, 2020

Republican House Reps. Liz Cheney (R-WY), Dan Bishop (R-NC), Greg Murphy (R-NC), David Rouzer (R-NC), Ted Budd (R-NC), Patrick McHenry (R-NC), Kenny Marchant (R-TX), and Rob Wittman (R-VA) also wrote letters asking for more foreign workers in January and February.

At the time, about 7.2 million Americans were unemployed and about 4.3 million Americans were underemployed, that is, working part-time jobs but wanting full-time employment.

Perdue, in his own letter asking for more foreign workers, wrote that “we are now seeing a situation where many American businesses need and are unable to find workers.”

“As our economy continues this historic recovery, it is becoming more difficult for American businesses to recruit and hire American workers for temporary and seasonal jobs,” Perdue wrote on February 6. “Many of these American businesses are at risk of irreparable harm if they do not receive the workers for whom they have petitioned.”

In a similar letter dated February 21, signed by Tillis, Burr, Bishop, Murphy, Rouzer, Budd, and McHenry, the North Carolina lawmakers suggested importing more foreign workers was “critically needed” for businesses to survive:

With the unemployment rate at a 50-year low, and in the midst of the longest economic expansion in U.S. history, these employers are struggling to find seasonal workers in this booming economy.

Cheney, in a January 29 letter, made it explicit that she was lobbying for additional foreign workers “on behalf of businesses in the great state of Wyoming.”

“Without significant H-2B cap relief, seasonal businesses will be forced to scale back operations, cancel or default on contracts, lay off full-time U.S. workers and, in some cases, close operations completely,” Cheney wrote.

As previously reported, on January 27, 26 Senate Republicans and 97 House Republicans signed a letter asking DHS to import more foreign workers. In May, even as 36 million Americans were out of work and underemployed, the lobbying by 47 Republicans for more foreign workers continued.

The lobbying helped pressure the State Department in March to begin fast-tracking foreign H-2B visa workers into U.S. jobs by deeming the pipeline as “essential to the economy and food security.”

Every year, U.S. companies are allowed to import 66,000 foreign H-2B visa workers to take blue-collar, non-agricultural jobs. For some time, the H-2B visa program has been used by businesses to bring in cheaper, foreign workers and has contributed to blue-collar Americans having their wages undercut.

Despite business claims, curbs to the H-2B visa program resulted in American teens and entry-level U.S. workers filling seasonal job spots. The most recent case shows that American college students are applying in droves for jobs at Colorado ski resorts that previously imported foreign workers.

Trump's June 22 visa-curbs create jobs for American youths on the nation's ski slopes.

Companies prefer to hire the gov't-supplied compliant blocs of foreign workers over independent US workers — and US journos have to pretend they don't notice. https://t.co/aCCRRmlLaN — Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) August 27, 2020

The H-2B visa program has been widely used by businesses to drag down the wages of American workers in landscaping, conservation work, the meatpacking industry, the construction industry, and fishing jobs, a 2019 study from the Center for Immigration Studies finds.

When comparing the wages of H-2B foreign workers to the national wage average for each blue-collar industry, about 21 out of 25 of the industries offered lower wages to foreign workers than Americans.

In the construction industry, wage suppression is significant, with H-2B foreign workers being offered more than 20 percent less than their American counterparts. In the fishing industry, foreign workers were offered more than 30 percent less for their jobs than Americans in the field. In the meatpacking industry, foreign workers got 23 percent less pay than Americans.

Every year, the U.S. admits about 1.2 million legal immigrants on green cards to permanently resettle in the country. In addition, another 1.4 million foreign workers are admitted every year to take American jobs

Jeff Van Drew (R-NJ) told the Republican National Convention Thursday night that the party he once knew turned from “liberal to radical” after seeing members of the far-left “Squad” take charge of the Democratic Party.

“How I became a Republican says a lot about today’s Democratic Party,” Van Drew said at the beginning of his speech.

The South Jersey congressman talked about when he was a local dentist and was asked by the Democratic Party to run for a town council seat.

“I had my doubts, and I explained that my views were middle-of-the-road to conservative,” Van Drew said.

But local leaders urged him that the Democrats were a “big tent” party.

As Van Drew advanced in his political career, he noticed that the Democrats as a party had become “less accepting of American tradition, less believing in American exceptionalism, and less supportive of traditional faith and family.”

“This was not the party that I knew,” he said. Once Van Drew was elected to Congress as a Democrat, he already showed his true colors by casting his first vote in Congress against Nancy Pelosi for speaker.

“Imagine how I felt after seeing members of The Squad quickly take control of the Democratic Party just weeks after being elected,” Van Drew said. “The party had moved from liberal to radical.”

“This new Democratic Party wasn’t just for higher taxes. Now they were for open borders, against our police, and against our God-given rights,” he continued.

After a “no” vote on impeachment, Van Drew met with President Donald Trump and changed his party affiliation to Republican.

Van Drew closed his speech by saying there are a lot of former Democrats who support Trump and are “disgusted” at what the Democrat Party had become.

Jeff Van Drew (R-NJ) said Thursday at the Republican National Convention (RNC).

“Democratic leaders told me that I had to vote for impeachment or my life would be made difficult and I wouldn’t be allowed to run again. Listen, I’m from South Jersey, and you’d better come at me with more than just loud words and empty threats,” Drew said.

The congressman continued:

I voted no on impeachment, and it was an easy call. Soon after, I met with President Trump, and he made me feel more comfortable and welcome in the Oval Office than Nancy Pelosi ever made me feel in her caucus. And a few days later, I officially changed parties, and I became a Republican.

When the Democrats tried to order him around, Van Drew was able to say, “I’ve had enough with their radical, socialist agenda.”

However, presidential candidate Joe Biden (D) was not able to say the same, the congressman said.

“Do you really believe Joe Biden is ready, willing, and, most of all, able to do the same? As Joe says, ‘Come on, man.’ Joe Biden is being told what to do by the radicals running my former party. The same radicals trying to install him as their puppet president,” he added.

In December 2019, Van Drew officially became a Republican and pledged his undying support for Trump during a meeting at the White House, according to Breitbart News.

President Trump said the congressman was “very smart because he knows it’s not going to be the minority for long,” adding, “I have a feeling we’re going to do very well in 2020.”

During his speech Thursday, Van Drew said America is the best nation in the world and President Trump helped make it such.

“There are a lot of Democrats who support our president and are disgusted for what their old party, what my old party, has become,” he said, then offered some advice.

Smith, who serves as the assistant to the president for domestic policy, opened up his remarks to the convention by discussing his own unique background and his personal connection to Trump. Smith said:

I grew up on Strandhill Road in Cleveland—a blue-collar street in a blue-collar city. When the media talks about forgotten places or the manufacturing decline in the rust belt or the plight of the working-class or the opioid epidemic, I just wonder what’s taken so long. But it’s funny—when they try to explain the connection to Donald Trump—there’s usually some stock photo of people who don’t look like me.

Discussing the president’s accomplishments for people of color, including boosting funding for historically black colleges and universities, Smith argued that Trump’s commitment to “revitalizing communities” was visible through his actions.

“Name an issue important to black communities—and it’s been a priority for him,” Smith said. “Prison reform, re-building broken families, bringing jobs back to America—jobs in Cleveland, jobs in Detroit, jobs in Milwaukee. Jobs for the future and jobs right here, right now.”

“And, in the wake of the murder of Breonna Taylor, George Floyd, and LeGend Taliferro—a moment of national racial consciousness—I have seen his true conscience,” he added. “I just wish every American could see the deep empathy he showed to families whose loved ones were killed in senseless violence.”

The speech comes as Trump is making a concerted play to broaden support among communities of color ahead of the general election. As such, the president’s reelection campaign has invested extensive resources in outreach and voter engagement aimed at people of color.

“They have hijacked and dismantled the criminal justice system. They have passed laws that made it impossible for police officers to do our job.”

“The violence and chaos we’re seeing now isn’t a side effect. It’s actually the goal,” Lynch said, adding “the radical left doesn’t really want better policing. They don’t really care about making the justice system fairer. What they want is no policing. What they want is a justice system that stops working altogether.”

Lynch said that the goal of the far left’s campaign against the police isn’t about genuine reform, but sending a message that “police officers are the enemy,” that “criminals have the right to resist arrest,” and that “if you victimize a vulnerable person, the justice system will not hold you accountable.”

“The criminals have heard that message, and they are taking full advantage,” said Lynch. “We must stop that message. We must expose the left’s lies about police officers and the job we do.”

“We look at the victims, the vulnerable, the regular working people who count on us. We know we can’t let them down.”

“Every day, our communities are asking us, why is this happening,” Lynch of said of surging crime rates. “The answer is simple, the Democrats have walked away from us. Democratic politicians have surrendered our streets and institutions.”

VERDICT: True. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris have both voiced support for a government-mandated buyback of AR-15s and other commonly-owned semiautomatic rifles.

Trump said, “If the left gains power, they will demolish the suburbs, confiscate your guns, and appoint justices who will wipe away your Second Amendment and other Constitutional freedoms.”

His claim that they “will confiscate your guns” is born out by statements both Biden and Harris made during the campaigns they ran in hopes of winning the Democrat presidential primary cycle.

On August 7, 2019, Breitbart News reported that Biden voiced support for mandatory buybacks of AR-15s and other commonly-owned semiautomatic rifles during the first Democrat debate of the primary cycle.

Biden said, “Folks, look, and I would buy back [assault] weapons. We already started talking about that. We tried to get it done. I think it can be done. And it should be demanded that we do it. And that’s a good expenditure of money.” [Emphasis added]

CNN: So, to gun owners out there who say, well, a Biden administration means they’re going to come for my guns? BIDEN: Bingo. You’re right if you have an assault weapon. The fact of the matter is, they should be illegal, period. Look, the Second Amendment doesn’t say you can’t restrict the kinds of weapons people can own. You can’t buy a bazooka. You can’t have a flame thrower.

In early September 2019, Breitbart News reported Harris’s support for government-mandated buybacks of AR-15 rifles. On September 6, 2019, Bloomberg reported that Harris had not worked out all the details on how the buyback would work, yet she said, “I think it’s a good idea.”

Her support of a mandatory buyback came weeks after then-presidential hopeful Robert “Beto” O’Rourke pushed for “a mandatory buyback of every assault weapon in our country.”

A government-mandated buyback is not a voluntary buyback, but a government-enforced buyback. It is the kind of buyback VOX reports that Australia implemented over the course of 1996-1997.

“As vice president, he supported the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which would have been a death sentence for the U.S. auto industry. He backed the horrendous South Korea trade deal, which took many jobs from our country,” Trump said.

“He repeatedly supported mass amnesty for illegal immigrants. He voted for the Iraq War. He opposed the mission to take out Osama bin Laden. He opposed killing Soleimani. He oversaw the rise of ISIS and cheered the rise of China as ‘a positive development’ for America and the world,” Trump said.

“That’s why China supports Joe Biden and desperately wants him to win, I can tell you that,” Trump continued, adding dryly, “upon very good information.”

He likely was referring to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s recent declaration on CNN that “China would prefer Joe Biden”:

“Unlike Biden, I will hold them fully accountable for the tragedy they caused.”

Reaves woke up Thursday to find a text from Tampa Bay Lightning defenseman Kevin Shattenkirk, prompting a conversation that helped lead the NHL to postpone four playoff games over two days.

“That, I think, was more powerful that the conversation started with white players on other teams wanting to talk,” said Reaves, who is Black. “And I think that’s the most powerful thing that happened today. You see us all coming together here.”

The NHL is back on pause a month into its playoffs, which followed a 4-1/2-month break caused by the coronavirus pandemic.

The decision to postpone two sets of second-round games Thursday and Friday was prompted by the threat of members of the Golden Knights and Vancouver Canucks preparing to sit out Game 3 of their series, and in the face of withering criticism from Black players accusing the league of being slow to acknowledge the police shooting of Jacob Blake in Wisconsin.

“After much discussion, NHL players believe that the best course of action would be to take a step back and not play tonight’s and tomorrow’s games as scheduled,” a joint statement released by the league and the NHL Players’ Association said. “Black and brown communities continue to face real, painful experiences. The NHL and NHLPA recognize that much work remains to be done before we can play an appropriate role in a discussion centered on diversity, inclusion and social justice.”

The announcement came an hour before the Philadelphia Flyers and New York Islanders were to play Game 3 of their series in Toronto, with Vegas and Vancouver to face off in Edmonton Alberta, later on Thursday.

The other postponed games were Game 4s on Friday: Boston against Tampa in Toronto, and Dallas against Colorado in Edmonton.

The NHL is pushing back its schedule to have the four games played Saturday.

Blake, who is Black, was shot in the back seven times Sunday by police in Kenosha, Wisconsin. The shooting sparked protests, and led to the NHL being questioned for allowing its playoffs to proceed Wednesday, when numerous other leagues — starting with the NBA — postponed games.

“We needed to make a stand, and I think this is the appropriate form of action,” Canucks captain Bo Horvat said. “I couldn’t be prouder of our group of guys to come up with this solution.”

Shattenkirk texted Reaves upon learning the Golden Knights were preparing to not play, and was struck by the tough guy’s message.

“When we got with them to speak with Ryan Reaves and talk about the issue at hand and how important this is, I think it was something we were fully behind,” Shattenkirk said.

“I think it unified us as a group to realize that any Black player in this league, any Black player who’s a kid coming up playing hockey can feel like that they have a voice, can feel that the NHL and the sport itself is a safe place and a place,” he added. “They have the support of every single one of us, and that’s what we’re trying to achieve here is inclusion.”

Reaves was impressed by the support, especially coming from a league predominantly made up of white players.

“Most of these guys have never lived through some of the stuff that Black athletes have,” he said.

“But for them to say, `Look, we see what’s going on in society and we disagree with it and something has to change now,′ that was my message,” Reaves said. “Standing together here is more powerful than anything you can do.”

The newly formed Hockey Diversity Alliance pressed the issue Thursday in publicly asking the NHL to postpone play by saying: “We strongly feel this sends a clear message that human rights take priority over sports.” The alliance is made up of nine current and former minority players.

Alliance co-founder Akim Aliu called the NHL’s initial inaction as being typical and disappointing.

“I thought it was very unfortunate and sad the NHL is always last to the dance in seeing all the other major sports, and what they did yesterday,” Aliu told The Associated Press by phone.

“It looks like the NHL is having a tough time of getting a grasp on things in their thinking and their views,” he added. “All we’re trying to do is work together with them to make our game a better game. And in some cases it’s like pulling teeth.”

The NHL’s decision caught several coaches off guard after spending the morning and early afternoon preparing to play.

Islanders coach Barry Trotz believed the best course forward was to continue playing, because the games provide players a platform.

“By you talking to me about it, to the players about it, it’s giving them a platform, it’s giving them air time,” Trotz said. “You want to keep the issue in the forefront.”",NHL Puts Off 2 Days of Playoff Games Amid Injustice Protests,fake

After other games around baseball were postponed to protest social injustice, the Mets were late to take the field Thursday and never submitted a lineup to the public or the umpires. Neither starting pitcher threw any warmup pitches. The teams stood around their dugouts in full uniforms shortly before the 7:10 p.m. scheduled first pitch, and the national anthem was played and all players and coaches stood.

The Mets and Marlins took the field, had a 42-second moment of silence, and then walked off. The only thing left on the field: a Black Lives Matter shirt.pic.twitter.com/JyckWkGQai — Complex Sports (@ComplexSports) August 27, 2020

Mets outfielder Dominic Smith — a Black man who wept Wednesday night while discussing the shooting by police of a Black man in Wisconsin over the weekend — led New York onto the field. Players took their positions, then reserves and coaches filed out of both dugouts and stood silently for 42 seconds.

Members on each team doffed caps towards the other side before returning to their clubhouses, leaving only the black T-shirt at home.

“The words on the shirt speak for themselves, just having it in the center of everything, just knowing that both teams are unified, and that we agreed to do this,” said Marlins outfielder Lewis Brinson, who was Miami’s leadoff hitter and stood near the batter’s box for the silent display. “And it was the right thing to do.”

The scene capped a whirlwind 20-hour span that began with Smith’s emotional press conference following the Mets’ 5-4 victory.

“It really touched all of us in the clubhouse, just to see how powerful his statements were, how emotional he was,” Conforto said “He’s our brother, so we stand behind him and we stand behind (Black Mets outfielder) Billy (Hamilton). All the players who stand up against the racial injustice, we stand behind them. And that’s what you saw tonight.”

Both teams held clubhouse meetings Thursday afternoon before Conforto, the Mets’ player representative, met with Brinson and Miguel Rojas, the Marlins’ player rep.

Conforto said Rojas came up with the idea of the teams walking off the field, and that it came together at the last minute. Conforto and Smith were seen talking with Brinson and Rojas as the teams warmed up.

“We wanted to do something special,” Rojas said. “We wanted to do something different.”

Smith, who implored people to give their time to inner-city communities on Wednesday night, said he’d heard from players in the NBA and NFL as well as baseball players such as Jack Flaherty who were interested in donating money and time to his foundation.

“It’s still overwhelming at this moment, just to see how moved my peers are, my teammates, my brothers, the front office, the coaching staff, everybody who talks to me on a daily basis,” Smith said. “Just to see how moved they were, it made me feel really good inside. It made me feel like we are on the right path of change.”

The 42-second moment of silence came a day before Major League Baseball plans to hold its annual Jackie Robinson Day, which was pushed back from the usual April 15 due to the pandemic.

“It needs to be an ongoing thing,” Brinson said. “It can’t just be one day out of the baseball year that we bring light to everything.”

The teams walked off about two hours after a video appeared on the league’s official website in which Mets general manager Brodie Van Wagenen said that his players did not want to play and they were waiting to hear from the Marlins about coordinating a postponement.

Van Wagenen also criticized Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred’s handling of player protests this week and alleged Manfred was pressuring New York to stage a symbolic walkout against players’ wishes, rather than a full postponement.

“That’s Rob’s instinct,” Van Wagenen said in a conversation he didn’t appear to know was being streamed on MLB.com. “At a leadership level, he doesn’t get it. He just doesn’t get it.”

Van Wagenen said in the video — after specifying the conversation “can’t leave this room” — that Manfred wanted the Mets and Marlins to walk off the field together shortly before the scheduled 7:10 p.m. first pitch, then come back and play at 8:10 p.m.

Van Wagenen apologized for his comments later Thursday, saying in a statement the idea to walk out and return was actually hatched by Mets Chief Operating Officer Jeff Wilpon.

“I have put myself and this organization into this conversation in a way that takes away from the real point,” Van Wagenen said on a conference call Thursday night. “I’m disappointed in myself.”

Manfred said in a statement that he has not tried to override players’ wishes to protest by not playing.

“Over the past two days, players on a number of Clubs have decided not to play games,” he said. “I have said both publicly and privately that I respect those decisions and support the need to address social injustice. I have not attempted in any way to prevent players from expressing themselves by not playing, nor have I suggested any alternative form of protest to any Club personnel or any player. Any suggestion to the contrary is wrong.”

Van Wagenen said he didn’t know how or when the Mets and Marlins, who were scheduled to complete their season series Thursday, would make up the game. The only mutual day off remaining for both teams is Monday.","WATCH: Mets, Marlins Observe Moment of Silence, Walk Off the Field, Leave BLM Shirt",fake

“Many of you know who I am, what I do, and that I am friends with the president,” White said. “I spoke at this convention four years ago, and I am back because I believe we need President Trump’s leadership now more than ever.”

“Before the pandemic, President Trump built the greatest economy in our nation’s history and created opportunities for all Americans like no one before him,” White continued. “Financial markets hit all-time highs, unemployment was at an all-time low, and we weren’t facing the lawless destruction that is now occurring in a few of our great cities.”

White also noted how law enforcement officials have been mistreated and “forgotten” by the Democrat Party and several of those who are protesting in the streets.

“It blows my mind how quickly some of the leadership in this country has forgotten the critical role first responders play in our society,” White stated. “Police departments and other law enforcement — even some fire departments — have faced opposition from many in this country. But they are always the people who are asked to step up when things are at their worst and they put themselves at risk.”

“C’mon, America. Defunding these vital positions is not the answer,” White declared. “The first responders have always taken care of us and now, more than ever, we need to take care of them.”

White, who served on a coronavirus recovery task force organized by President Trump, transitioned his speech into a conversation on the coronavirus pandemic.

“Let’s talk about COVID, and let’s be very honest about it,” White said. “No one person and no one place could have anticipated the challenges that COVID would bring, but President Trump has faced all these obstacles head-on. He immediately put detective measures in place and he reached out to the best and brightest leading American businesses across all leading industries to see what his economy could do to get the country up and running again, safely.”

White also said that President Trump’s “highest priority was always the health and safety of everyone in our country. Not just Republicans, not just supporters, but every single American.”

White also commended President Trump’s efforts to bring back “entertainment options” to cope with recovery efforts during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Marlow joined Rachel Bovard, senior director of the Conservative Partnership Institute, to evaluate the week’s ongoing Republican National Convention (RNC) with hosts Helen Andrews, Arthur Bloom, and Ryan Girdusky He praised Melania Trump as the star of Tuesday’s RNC speakers.

“The story of the night was Melania,” declared Marlow. “I think she’s unbelievable, one of the most underrated people, not just as a first lady and as a Trump, but in terms of people who are contributors to American life and culture. She’s taken so many slings and arrows being a cultural figure.”

Marlow continued, “The content of her speech was so epic: throwdowns on communism, appeals to patriotism, [and] appeals to unity. There was so much content in there that I thought was both uplifting and unifying, and a stern rebuke of the incredible darkness and gloominess of the Democrats’ message that we heard all last week.”

Melania Trump’s life story is illustrative of the American Dream, assessed Marlow.

“This is a hopeful story — a rags-to-riches story — and something that really is only possible in the United States. Now, granted, if you’re as beautiful as Melania, then it certainly helps your case. But it is an amazing story, and I think her story appeals to all Americans.”

LISTEN:

The Associated Press described Sevnica — the town in Slovenia where Melania Trump grew up during the coutnry’s former communist era — as “a sleepy industrial town.” It wrote, “She grew up in Communist-era apartment blocks overlooking a river and ever-smoking factory chimneys,” noting that her father was a car dealer and her mother worked in a textile factory.

Breitbart News’s Penny Starr visited and profiled Sevnica in a 2017. The profile featured a description of the “First Lady tour,” a two-hour walking trip that winds through the streets to visit shops that carry White House slippers and Prva Dama (First Lady) apple pie.

Marlow urged President Donald Trump and Republicans to emphasize the benefits of improved immigration policies for some American minorities,.

“I would love to hear more conversation about immigration and visas,” Marlow stated. “It isn’t just about illegal immigration. It’s about legal immigration, as well. We can’t have tens of millions of new unemployed people and be importing a new class of people who compete with them for jobs and wages.”

Marlow added, “I think there are many people in the president’s inner circle who think a strong immigration policy doesn’t project well — that it projects as racist — and that’s the opposite of the case. It actually protects minority workers who are Americans more than any other group, arguably.”

Marlow concluded, “That’s the fear I have, that they’re so afraid of the charge of being called racist that they’re going to run away from [a strong immigration policy]. It’s really been a remarkable year on the immigration agenda … and they should be touting that.”

VERDICT: FALSE. And CNN’s Anderson Cooper failed to correct Biden on the air for an easily disprovable lie.

Biden told Anderson Cooper that Trump had never condemned white supremacists. He also repeated — word-for-word — his script for the debunked “very fine people” hoax, and claimed — falsely — that Trump has never condemned David Duke.

Biden said:

Have you ever heard this president say one negative thing about white supremacists? Have you ever heard it? That’s the reason I got back in this race because of what happened in Charlottesville. People coming out of the woods carrying torches, their veins bulging. Close your eyes and remember what you saw. And a young woman gets killed, that resisting the hate and violence. And the president gets asked to comment on it. what does he say? He says there were “very fine people on both sides.” He wouldn’t even condemn David Duke, for God’s sake.

Trump has repeatedly condemned white supremacists. Here’s “one negative thing” — from a televised White House address:

No matter the color of our skin, we all live under the same laws, we all salute the same great flag, and we are all made by the same almighty God. We must love each other, show affection for each other, and unite together in condemnation of hatred, bigotry, and violence. We must rediscover the bonds of love and loyalty that bring us together as Americans. Racism is evil. And those who cause violence in its name are criminals and thugs, including the KKK, neo-Nazis, white supremacists, and other hate groups that are repugnant to everything we hold dear as Americans. We are a nation founded on the truth that all of us are created equal. We are equal in the eyes of our Creator. We are equal under the law. And we are equal under our Constitution. Those who spread violence in the name of bigotry strike at the very core of America.

There are many other such examples. Biden’s claim was a lie, and Anderson Cooper failed to confront him with the facts.

Notably, Biden has an egregious records of racist statements, most recently claiming “you ain’t black” if you vote for Trump.

Biden, appearing from his Wilmington, Delaware, home, said that he would be a fact-checker for Trump when they debated one another, dismissing suggestions that he should decline debates unless Trump’s claims were fact-checked in real time onstage.

But it is Biden who might need professional fact-checking intervention, judging by his performance in the interview, when he made several demonstrably false claims that Mitchell never bothered to correct or to ask him to justify or clarify.

Charlottesville “very fine people” hoax. Biden again claimed falsely that President Trump had referred to neo-Nazis and white supremacists in Charlottesville, Virginia, as “very fine people.” This is a lie that has been debunked repeatedly — and yet Biden persists with it, even though he has been challenged directly about the fact that he is misquoting Trump, who said the neo-Nazis and white supremacists should be “condemned totally.” The “very fine people” were non-violent protesters on either side of the issue of the removal of a statue of Confederate general Robert E. Lee from a local park, not the extremists.

Biden claimed that President Trump is doing “nothing” about coronavirus. This is a nonsense claim. Biden could have criticized specific things Trump has done, but the idea that he has done “nothing” is ludicrous. From the China travel ban — which Biden opposed; to the coronavirus task force; to the CARES Act; to the Payment Protection Program; to Operation Warp Speed on vaccines (see below); to invoking the Defense Production Act to manufacture much-needed ventilators and personal protective equipment; to the mobilization of military hospitals and ships; Trump has done plenty of things.

Biden claimed the Republican National Convention (RNC) “didn’t speak about COVID.” Several speakers at the RNC spoke about the coronavirus, or COVID-19, and the president specifically honored medical professionals on the front lines. First Lady Melania Trump shared the grief of those families who have lost loved ones to the disease, as did Vice President Mike Pence. Biden’s statement is utterly indefensible and suggests he did not watch the RNC, but had it summarized for him.

Biden claimed that Trump talked about “injecting bleach.” Trump never said that. He talked about injecting ultraviolet (UV) light, a long-used disinfectant, into the lungs as an experimental therapy. When a journalist asked whether he meant to encourage injecting bleach, Trump specifically said no. “It wouldn’t be through injection. We’re talking about through almost a cleaning, sterilization of an area.” Trump’s remarks were widely misconstrued, and Biden continues to misquote him.

Biden claimed that the Trump administration had no plan for distributing a vaccine for coronavirus. The plan is called Operation Warp Speed, and the president talks about it frequently. The goal of the plan is to distribute 300 million doses of vaccine to the entire country — something Biden specifically claimed Trump had no plan to do. The plans and documents are available on the website of the Department of Health and Human Services, and have been available there for months.

Biden claimed that there were no race riots during the Obama-Biden administration and the National Guard was never called. He seemed to have forgotten that the Black Lives Matter movement started in 2014, and rioted in Ferguson, Missouri; or that the National Guard were called in to quell race riots in Baltimore, Maryland after the death of Freddie Gray in police custody in 2015; or that five police were murdered in Dallas, Texas, during a Black Lives Matter march in 2016.

Biden claimed that Kellyanne Conway said Republicans were encouraging violence because it helped them politically. Her exact quote was: “The more chaos and anarchy and vandalism and violence reigns, the better it is for the very clear choice on who’s best on public safety and law and order.” Biden omitted the context, in which Conway had pointed out that Democrat mayors and governors had refused President Trump’s offers to send help to stop the violence and the looting.

“Jacob Blake was never mentioned in any of the speeches at the Republican convention.” This last lie was told by Mitchell herself. The opening speech of the second night of the RNC referred to Blake specifically. Pastor Norma Urrabazo offered an opening prayer in which she said: “Lord, we come before you to ask for your spirit of peace to come over hurting communities in Wisconsin tonight. We pray for healing and comfort to Jacob Blake and his family. We pray for your protection over those who put their lives in harm’s way to bring safety and security to our streets.” Mitchell was wrong.

We can’t sit by and allow that to happen. As lifelong Republicans, we came to this conclusion in different ways and at different times. Some of us voted for Trump in 2016, excited for a no-nonsense political outsider to take on the Washington status quo.

Romney, whose presidential campaign became defined by his claim that “corporations are people,” garnered just 47 percent in 2012 against Obama’s 51 percent. Trump, with his economic nationalist agenda, blew away Democrat Hillary Clinton by winning states such as Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Florida.

“Obama lost the midterms in 2010 but won re-election, largely because he ran as the populist candidate of change against the corporatist Mitt Romney,” anti-monopolist Matt Stoller has said. “That was a blown election for the GOP; they should have won it.”

As Breitbart News reported, the Romney staffers now join hundreds of former staffers from McCain’s failed 2008 presidential campaign against President Obama and former Bush staffers.

Likewise, the Romney, McCain, Bush staffers join former Department of Homeland Security (DHS) staffers — who worked for the agency in 2017, 2018, and 2019 — in their pledge to help elect Biden and Harris.

Former presidential candidate and columnist Pat Buchanan said Trump’s populist transformation of the Republican Party has shut the door on the 2008 and 2012 business-centric platforms.

Fighting back tears, Dorn recounted the story of her husband’s murder, which was livestreamed to the internet by his killers during a night of rioting and looting in St. Louis, Missouri on June 2nd.

“I relive that horror in my mind every single day.”

“My hope is that having you relive it with me now will help shake this country from this nightmare we are witnessing in our cities, and bring about positive, peaceful change.”

“How did we get to this point, where so many young people are callous and indifferent towards human life?”

“David is never, never coming back to me. He was murdered by people who didn’t know, and just didn’t care. He would have done anything to help them.”

“Violence and destruction are not legitimate forms of protest. They do not safeguard black lives. They only destroy them.”

“President Trump understands this, has offered federal help to restore order in our communities. In a time when police departments are short on resources and manpower, we need that help. We should accept that help!”

“We cannot heal amid devastation and chaos. President Trump knows we need more Davids in our communities, not fewer. We need to come together in peace and remember that every life is precious,” Dorn concluded.

“In the wake of the murder of Breonna Taylor, George Floyd, and LeGend Taliferro — a moment of national racial consciousness — I have seen his true conscience,” Smith said. “I just wish every American could see the deep empathy he showed to families whose loved ones were killed in senseless violence.”

Smith was likely referring to the president’s meeting in June with black family members who lost loved ones in incidents of police violence and crime — Ahmaud Arbery, Botham Jean, Antwon Rose II, Jemel Roberson, Atatiana Jefferson, Michael Dean, Darius Tarver, Everett Palmer, Jr., and Cameron Lamb.

The June meeting was closed to the press but took place before he signed an executive order to move forward on issues of police reform.

Smith spoke about his experience growing up and meeting Republicans in Washington, DC, who were eager to assist on issues important to the black community.

“Growing up, I’d never really known a Republican. I believed all the stereotypes. It took a meeting with Republicans who shared my values to show me that I was wrong,” he said.

Smith said that Trump understood the importance of healing broken families, bringing jobs back to cities like Cleveland, Detroit, and Milwaukee; and supporting permanent government funding for historic black colleges and universities and creating opportunity zones in urban neighborhoods.

He also said that Trump was keeping his promises, suggesting that Democrats had started taking black voters for granted.

Smith compared Trump’s personality to the people he grew up with in Cleveland.

“They’re tough, smart, and tell it like it is and they’re ready for real action,” he said. “That’s President Trump. For a New Yorker, he’s got a lot of Cleveland heart.”",Ja'Ron Smith: Trump Has Deep Empathy for Black Victims of Violence,fake

Kim Reynolds (R) announced the closure of bars and nightclubs in six counties on Thursday due to a spike of Chinese coronavirus cases among the young.

Bars, nightclubs, breweries, wineries, and distilleries in six counties — Polk, Linn, Johnson, Story, Dallas, and Black Hawk — will be forced to close beginning Thursday at 5:00 p.m. because of an increase in positivity rates among those ages 19-24.

“They may continue to sell alcoholic beverages for consumption off premises. Restaurants in these six counties are permitted to remain open, but must stop selling and serving alcoholic beverages after 10:00 p.m.,” an announcement of the proclamation states.

While she acknowledged that the younger demographic is less likely to suffer severe impacts of the virus, she said the actions are “increasing the virus activity in the community and it’s spilling over to other segments of the population.” The age group has comprised nearly one-quarter of new positive cases across the state in the last two weeks.

“I don’t make these decisions lightly, and it’s not lost on me that every business forced to close all through their hours and sales, even temporarily, plays a role in the lives of Iowa workers and our small businesses,” Reynolds said, according to the Des Moines Register.

“But these actions are absolutely necessary,” she continued.

The Iowa Department of Public Health reported 1,475 new cases of the virus on Thursday, bringing the total to 59,368 cases and 1,079 related fatalities. According to KCCI, Thursday’s numbers reflected the “largest single-day increase in overall coronavirus cases since the pandemic began”:

IDPH reports seven Iowa counties with a positivity rate greater than 15% over the last 14 days. Plymouth, Howard, Sioux, Johnson, Clinton, Carroll, Marion and Lee counties are above the 15% threshold that triggers considerations for public schools to change to online learning.

Reynolds’ restrictions are set to remain in effect until September 20, although she expressed hope that officials will be able to loosen them “in the near future.”

“But if they simply move large scale parties and other high-risk activity elsewhere, then we’re going to be prepared to do more,” she cautioned.","Iowa Governor Shuts Down Bars, Nightclubs over Coronavirus Spike",fake

VERDICT: MOSTLY TRUE. The first known non-travel spread happened in mid-February; the travel ban was Jan. 31.

Vice President Mike Pence addressed the Republican National Convention (RNC) on Wednesday evening. Among other achievements, he listed President Trump’s leadership on the coronavirus, and said: “Before the first case of coronavirus spread within the United States, President Trump took the unprecedented step of suspending all travel from China.”

That is probably true, though it is impossible to know with certainty, because there could have been asymptomatic cases. There are also questions about whether the virus may have spread to the U.S. earlier than it was detected in January. The first known case arrived from China on January 15, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) detected the first known community transmission case on February 26.

The CDC reported in June:

From January 21 through February 23, 2020, public health agencies detected 14 U.S. cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), all related to travel from China (1,2). The first nontravel–related U.S. case was confirmed on February 26 in a California resident who had become ill on February 13 (3). Two days later, on February 28, a second nontravel–related case was confirmed in the state of Washington (4,5). Examination of four lines of evidence provides insight into the timing of introduction and early transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, into the United States before the detection of these two cases. First, syndromic surveillance based on emergency department records from counties affected early by the pandemic did not show an increase in visits for COVID-19–like illness before February 28. Second, retrospective SARS-CoV-2 testing of approximately 11,000 respiratory specimens from several U.S. locations beginning January 1 identified no positive results before February 20. Third, analysis of viral RNA sequences from early cases suggested that a single lineage of virus imported directly or indirectly from China began circulating in the United States between January 18 and February 9, followed by several SARS-CoV-2 importations from Europe. Finally, the occurrence of three cases, one in a California resident who died on February 6, a second in another resident of the same county who died February 17, and a third in an unidentified passenger or crew member aboard a Pacific cruise ship that left San Francisco on February 11, confirms cryptic circulation of the virus by early February. These data indicate that sustained, community transmission had begun before detection of the first two nontravel–related U.S. cases, likely resulting from the importation of a single lineage of virus from China in late January or early February, followed by several importations from Europe. The widespread emergence of COVID-19 throughout the United States after February highlights the importance of robust public health systems to respond rapidly to emerging infectious threats.

At the time Trump imposed the travel ban on China, former Vice President Joe Biden called it “hysterical xenophobia.” Two months later, Biden changed his mind.

Trump imposed the ban when there were fewer than ten cases and no deaths, buying time and saving lives, as Dr. Anthony Fauci has testified.

“We’ve reached our breaking point,” Acting Director Matthew W. Garbark said during a press conference, according to CBS Baltimore.

The report continued:

By cancelling curbside recycling pickup, DPW officials say their employees and contractors can focus on trash pick up. The coronavirus pandemic has increased the amount of residential trash in the city, officials said, as well as leading to come employees contracting the virus.

Following the first outbreak of the coronavirus at one of its facilities, a second was reported on July 17 at another facility and the department sent everyone except a few workers home to quarantine and closed the landfill for two days.

“The threat of COVID and the potential exposure employees have given them, given their public facing jobs has remained a serious fear,” Garbark said, adding that record heat was also a factor and some workers took leave due to heat-related illnesses.

“Our employees are also required to wear masks at all times, which restricts breathing, and can increase heat related illness as well. Our crews were quite simply, exhausted,” he noted.

In August, more workers called out and the department directed recycling crews to pick up trash.

“As the number of missed routes grows, we have been unable to make up collections the next day. The backlog has become so significant that it has taken days, or sometimes over a week, to make up the missed collection routes trash and recycling,” Garbark said.

The city reportedly sought help from contractors but received little to no interest, according to the CBS article.

In a recent scathing campaign video that received over 11 million views, Republican Congressional candidate Kimberly Klacik criticized Democrats for mismanaging the city.

“Do you care about black lives? The people that run Baltimore don’t,” Klacik stated:

Democrats don’t want you to see this. They’re scared that I’m exposing what life is like in Democrat run cities. That’s why I’m running for Congress

“As Republicans — we are proud to stand with him and to work for you. Together we built the greatest economy the world has ever seen — and we will do it again,” McCarthy said.

McCarthy added that Trump and congressional Republicans tackled unfair trade deals and pursued better trade deals with the United States-Mexico-Canada (USMCA) Agreement.

He added that they restored “law and order at the border.”

McCarthy said that Trump has worked to combat the coronavirus pandemic. He said:



But as every American knows, we face an invisible enemy that we didn’t ask for, nor invite. But we will defeat it. We will defeat it because America is where innovation happens — and we are developing a vaccine in record time. We will defeat it because President Trump unleashed a Marshall Plan for main street — and put hard working taxpayers back on their feet. We will defeat it because tough times don’t last — tough Americans do. And that is what this election is all about — you, not us.



Joe Biden and Kamala Harris think this election is about the government. They are wrong. It’s about your family and your future.

“As Republicans, it’s our mission to renew the American dream. Restore our way of life. And rebuild the greatest economy in the world,” he added.

McCarthy cautioned that Democrats would only make the country unsafe. He explained:

The Socialist Democrats have a different agenda. They will dismantle our institutions. Defund our police. And destroy our economy. So, as you cast your vote this November remember this… Four years ago, President Trump promised to be your voice. He kept that promise — but there is still so much more to do. The choice before you could not be clearer…

That, according to Heilemann, caused “domestic terrorists” like 17-year-old Kyle Rittenhouse to go to Kenosha during protests over the police shooting of Jacob Blake.

Heilemann said, “We’re four days into this convention. Jacob Blake was shot in the back seven times on Monday. Donald Trump has not said his name in four days. Donald Trump has only talked about Kenosha and the context yesterday of sending a tweet out that said, ‘We’re going to send federal forces in to get control of the city of Kenosha,’ in the context of the shootings that took place there. We now have a suspect in those shootings. We have a 17-year-old white kid. There’s video of that kid at a Donald Trump rally in the front row in Iowa on January 30th.”

He continued, “That kid with a long gun who lives in Illinois, traveled up to Kenosha to get in the middle of this. He’s got social media that says ‘Back the Blue, ‘Blue Lives Matter. He has social media that says he’s a huge fan of Donald Trump. That kid, that white 17-year-old kid who went up there, who is a domestic terrorist, is exactly what this former Trump administration official says is making our job harder. Yes, he’s giving permission to domestic terrorists who are white supremacists. I don’t know this 17-year-old kid, but you look at his social media and his profile, he sure looks like a white supremacist. If he’s not an out front, straight-up, white supremacist, then at the very least, he is a domestic terrorist. Anybody who leaves their home drives to another state and shoots two people on the street meets the legal and practical definition of a domestic terrorist.”

He added, “We’re seeing it now in Trump’s silence about Jacob Blake this week is another version of the permission structure that allows those kinds of feelings to take root and those behaviors to happen with impunity. Again, I withhold judgment. We have not heard the president speak tonight, but so far we’re four days into this and what the president said and what he hasn’t said is exactly the problem and gives exactly the kind of implicit, racially, incendiary message that gets sent that allows this violence to take place and encourages it. And is exactly what that woman and many other people who have watched him over the last four years have pointed to as the problem.”

August 27, 2020 During the early evening hours of August 26, 2020 Kenosha Police Department received a citizen tip alerting us to several suspicious vehicles with out of state plates meeting in a remote lot near State Highway 50 and Green Bay Road. Acting on this information Kenosha Police Offices located the suspicious vehicles and took up surveillance. Kenosha Police were assisted by the United States Marshals. The vehicles were a black school bus, bread truck and tan minivan. Kenosha Police confirmed the out of state license plates. Police followed the vehicles to a gas station near Washington Road and 30th Avenue. Police observed the occupants of the black bus and bread truck exit and attempt to fill multiple fuel cans. Suspecting that the occupants of these vehicles were preparing for criminal activity related to the civil unrest, officers attempted to make contact and investigate. The officers exited their vehicles, identified themselves, were wearing appropriate identification, and then detained the occupants of the bus and bread truck. The minivan attempted to drive away; however, Kenosha Police stopped this vehicle and ultimately forced entry to the minivan and arrested the occupants. The vehicles contained various items that included helmets, gas masks, protective vests, illegal fireworks, and suspected controlled substances. The 9 individuals were arrested for disorderly conduct and are pending charging decisions by the Kenosha County District Attorney.

Co-host Chris Hayes said, “There has been a glorification of vigilante violence by Donald Trump, by supporters of his on the campaign trail when he instructed his supporters to beat up and assault protesters when he said he would pay their legal fees. We had a deranged fan of his attempt to assassinate a dozen members of the political opposition just a few weeks before the midterm elections. We had someone who cited his immigration policy go and attempt to murder as many Latinos down in Texas as possible. We have seen time and time again, a call in response from the rhetoric that comes from the president and his supporters and the actions of some violent individuals. To say after the fact this 17-year-old commit this and then be celebrated after the fact, after people have seen what the results of that rhetoric is, that is stepping out and transgressing to me in an even more disturbing fashion.”

Wallace said, “Let me just give you a thought, having been inside campaigns. It is also a trap. Donald Trump, he didn’t spend any money because he prostituted the White House and the countries assets to do this convention, but he spent a lot of time putting together a convention to talk to a very small group of people, like smaller than the number of people that have been watching us all week.

English and his fellow contractor Anthony Buckley helped the police officers rescue three teenage girls, their teenage brother, and their dog from a second-story window.

Officer Jarrad Cockshoot was specially recognized for placing himself in harm’s way during an extremely dangerous situation.

He “immediately climbed up the ladder — without hesitation and without due regard for his own safety” and helped the three girls out of the window, said Davenport Fire Chief Mike Carlsten.

A video played at the ceremony showed the tense moments when Officer Cockshoot ascended the ladder and got them to safety.

Once they were on the ground, he climbed back up the ladder in an attempt to save their dog but was unable to because of its size and the thick smoke.

“The reality is that the life of a black person in America has never been treated as fully human,” Harris said. “We have yet to fulfill that promise of equal justice under the law.”

“It’s no wonder people are taking to the streets. And I support them,” she added in another part of the speech. “We must always defend peaceful protests and peaceful protestors. We should not confuse them with those looting and committing acts of violence, including the shooter who was arrested for murder.”

Harris’s speech came as protests and rioting have continued to roil portions of Wisconsin. The tumult began on Sunday in Kenosha, Wisconsin, when local police shot Blake, a 29-year-old black American man, several times in the back. According to local media reports, police were called to respond to a “domestic incident” at the site of the shooting. Several witnesses have claimed that Blake was attempting to break up a fight between two women when police arrived.

Video from the scene, which went viral on social media, shows Blake walking away from police as the officers have their weapons drawn. In the video, Blake is seen opening the door of an SUV as a police officer attempts to stop him before firing at least seven shots into his back.

After the video of the shooting appeared on social media, protests erupted on the streets of Kenosha. Those protests quickly turned violent. On Monday, in particular, several businesses were burnt to the ground, including, a local charity.

The situation only intensified on Tuesday with more looting and confrontations occurring across Kenosha. One of those incidents caught national attention when a 17-year-old Illinois resident, Kyle Rittenhouse, killed two individuals and wounded a third with a rifle. Rittenhouse, who had identified himself as a supporter of law enforcement, was arrested on Wednesday for the shootings.

In the wake of such incidents, the Department of Justice announced it is deploying federal resources to Wisconsin to help quell the unrest.",Harris: Black Lives have 'Never Been Treated as Fully Human' in America,fake

11:25 PM: On CNN, Jake Tapper immediately rips Pence for “whitewashing” the administration’s Coronavirus record.

10:32 PM: From Baltimore’s Fort McHenry, Pence ready to deliver his speech. Pence says it is an honor to speak from the hallowed grounds of Fort McHenry that inspired our national anthem. Pence rips Democrats for spending four days attacking America and talking about a “season of darkness.” He says while Biden sees a season of darkness, “we see American greatness.” Pence says in this challenging times, we need a president who actually believes in America.

Pence says his prayers are with the families in the path of Hurricane Lara. He says for four years, he has seen Trump get up from unrelenting attacks to fight for the American people before saying he humbly accepts the nomination to serve four more years as vice president of the United States.

BREAKING: Vice Pres. Mike Pence: ""With gratitude for the confidence Pres. Donald Trump has placed in me, the support of our Republican Party, and the grace of God, I humbly accept your nomination to run and serve as Vice President."" https://t.co/Bu1ofYBbLe #RNC2020 pic.twitter.com/Cg7hrmbGte — ABC News (@ABC) August 27, 2020

He says Trump sees America as a nation that has done more good than any other and a nation that deserves far more gratitude than grievance.

Pence talks up Trump’s military accomplishments, including the Space Force and reforming the VA.

He now there are four recipients of the Medal of Honor, six recipients of the Purple Heart, and a Gold Star mother along with Wounded Warriors in the audience. Pence rips Biden for criticizing Trump for ridding the world of two terrorists. He says it’s no surprise because Biden even opposed the mission to hunt down Osama bin Laden. He says no wonder a Secretary of Defense said Biden has been wrong on nearly every national security issue for the last four decades.

Pence now talking about moving the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem and the Israel-UAE peace deal before talking about the conservative judges Trump appointed.

On the economy, Pence says Trump “kept his word and then some.” Tax cuts. Rolling back red tape. Unleashing American energy and fighting for free and fair trade.

Pence says America became a net exporter of energy for the first time in 70 years while unemployment rates for African-Americans and Hispanic-Americans hit record lows.

And then, he says, the Coronavirus struck from China. Pence says before the first case spread, Trump suspended travel from China and that saved American lives and “bought us invaluable time” to combat the Coronavirus.

Pence says nobody who needed a ventilator was denied one and talks up the administration’s economic recovery plan.

He says Biden said that “no miracle is coming,” but Biden doesn’t understand that “America is a nation of miracles.” He says America is on track to have a Coronavirus vaccine by the end of this year.

Pence says we’re not just opening up America again but we’re also opening up America’s schools. He says his wife Karen is returning to her classroom next week. He thanks teachers for being there for the kids.

Pence asks voters as we open the country back up to ask themselves: “On November 3rd, ask yourself: Who do you trust to rebuild this economy? A career politician who presided over the slowest economic recovery since the Great Depression? Or a proven leader who created the greatest economy in the world?”

He says we need four more years of Trump in the White House to bring America back.

Pence says he and Trump will always support peaceful protests but rioting and looting are not peaceful protests and tearing down statues is not free speech. He says Biden didn’t say one word last week about the violence and chaos engulfing the cities. Pence says he wants to be clear: “The violence must stop.”

Pence says we will have law and order on the streets of America for Americans of every race, creed, and color.

Pence says the he and Trump know that “the men and women that put on the uniform of law enforcement are the best of us.”

Pence says the American people know that you do not have to choose between supporting law enforcement and African-Americans. He says the Trump administration has done both since day one.

Pence says Biden thinks America is systemically racist and law enforcement has an implicit bias against people of color, and he will double down on the policies that are causing violence all over America.

“The hard truth is you won’t be safe in Joe Biden’s America,” he says before saying the Trump administration will always stand with the thin blue line and will never defund the the police–not now, not ever.

Pence asks what Biden is a transition to–he says Democrats didn’t talk much about agenda and he doesn’t blame them. Pence notes that Bernie Sanders said that many of the ideas he fought for are now mainstream. He says at the root of their agenda is that America is driven by envy and the federal government must be involved in every aspect of our lives to “correct America’s wrongs.”

“Their agenda is based on government control,” Pence says. “Ours is based on freedom.”

Pence rips Biden for wanting to give free health care and lawyers to illegal immigrants.

Pence says Biden supports taxpayer-funded abortion right up to birth, and Biden will be a “Trojan Horse” for the radical left.

Pence says this election is not so much whether America will be more conservative or liberal. He says the choice is whether America remains America, whether we live to our children and grandchildren a country grounded in our highest ideals… or whether we will leave a country that has fundamentally transformed into something else. He says the election is between “freedom and opportunity” and “socialism and decline.”

Pence closes by talking about the toughness that runs in our national character that invading forces learned on approach to this fort on September 1814. Against fierce and sustained bombardment, our young country was defended by heroes, not so different from those with us tonight. The enemy was counting on them to quit. But they never did. Fort McHenry held. And when morning came our flag was still here.

My fellow Americans, we are going through a time of testing. But if you look through the fog of these challenging times, you will see our flag is still there.”

“From these hallowed grounds, American patriots in generations gone by did their part to defend freedom. Now it’s our turn.

So let’s run the race marked out for us. Let’s fix our eyes on Old Glory and all she represents, fix our eyes on this land of heroes and let their courage inspire, let’s fix our eyes on the author and perfector of our faith and freedom, and never forget that ‘where the spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom.’ That means freedom always wins,” Pence says.

Trump joins him on stage as the Trace Adkins performs the National Anthem.

He says he leaves inspired and more convinced that Americans will re-elect Trump so they can “make America great again, again.”

10:19 PM: Ric Grenell said during the presidential debates four years ago only one candidate (Trump) said what everyone was thinking inside re: American foreign policy.

“He called America’s endless wars what they were: A disaster,” he says. “The media was shocked, because Donald Trump was running as a Republican. And yet he said out loud what we all knew. That American foreign policy was failing to make Americans safer.”

Grenell says that “after the end of the Cold War, Democrats and Republicans in Washington bought into the illusion that the whole world would start to resemble America. And so they started to pursue unlimited globalization.”

“They welcomed China into the World Trade Organization. They engaged in nation-building in Afghanistan, and tried to export democracy to Iraq. They signed a nuclear deal with Iran, and a global climate agreement in Paris,” he says. “But they didn’t ground any of it in the interests of the average American. So for decades, while Washington politicians built a global system, American wages stagnated. Our great cities and industries were hollowed out. Entire communities were devastated, and our manufacturing plants were shipped off to China. That’s what happened when Washington stopped being the capital of the United States, and started being the capital of the world.”

He says he saw Trump charm Merkel and tell other leaders he didn’t fault them for outmaneuvering America’s past leaders but it stops with him.

He says Trump has not started any new wars and even convinced Democrats of China’s threat.

“The Washington elites want you to think this kind of foreign policy is immoral. And so they call it nationalist,” he says. “That tells you all you need to know. The DC crowd thinks when they call Donald Trump a nationalist, they’re insulting him. As if the American president isn’t supposed to base foreign policy on America’s national interests.”

Richard Grenell: ""The D.C. crowd think when they call Donald Trump a nationalist, they're insulting him. As if the American president isn't supposed to base foreign policy on America's national interests."" https://t.co/Bu1ofYBbLe pic.twitter.com/mbItNplvtr — ABC News (@ABC) August 27, 2020

He says while Obama-Biden sent an airplane with cash to Iran, Trump “also sent an aircraft in the middle of night to deal with Iran. But that plane was on a different mission – an air strike to take out the head of Iran’s terror machine who plotted the deaths of Americans.”

After ripping Obama-Biden for spying on Trump officials and the Russia collusion hoax, Grenell explains Trump’s “America First” foreign policy: America First does not advance the interests of one group of Americans at the expense of any other. It has no bias about red or blue, educated or not educated, urban or rural. America First is simply the belief that politicians should focus on the equality and dignity of every American. nd that this duty is fulfilled by promoting the safety and wealth of the American people above all else. That’s America First. That’s the Trump Doctrine. And that, my friends, is four more years.”

10:15 PM: Clarence Henderson, who participated in the Woolworth sit-ins, says he was born on the wrong side of the tracks, doesn’t have a birth certificate, never attended integrated schools, is a civil rights activists…and is a Republican who supports Donald Trump.

“If that sounds strange to you, learn your history,” he says. “It was the Republican Party that passed the 13th Amendment abolishing slavery; it was the Republican Party that passed the 14th Amendment giving black men citizenship; and it was the Republican Party that passed the 15th Amendment giving Black men the right to vote.”

C-SPAN

He adds that “there are African-American voters all over the country who the media is trying to convince to conform to the same old Democratic talking points. You know what that’ll get you? The same old results.”

He jabs Biden: “Joe Biden had the audacity to say if you don’t vote for him ‘you ain’t black.'” Well to that, I say, if you do vote for Biden, you ain’t smart!”

He says Trump’s policies show his heart and show that he cares about Black lives. He says Trump has done more for Blacks in four years than Biden has done in 50.

10:12 PM: Sam Vigil says there is a hole in his heart since his wife Jackie, who was killed in her driveway, was taken from him.

“Albuquerque, where we live, is one of the most violent cities in the country. Fewer than 50 percent of homicides are solved. It is a sad irony that Jackie immigrated to the U.S. for a better life than her native Colombia only to be gunned down in her own driveway,” he says. “For over eight months, there were no arrests and no leads in connection with Jackie’s murder. The police were overwhelmed. They needed help.”

He says helped arrived with President Trump and the FBI took over Jackie’s case. He says they arrested four men in a matter of days and the fifth, the suspected killer, is an illegal alien with a criminal record.

“He had been deported in September and had come back in October to terrorize our community,” he says.

“I am extremely grateful to President Trump and the FBI for their efforts to deliver justice for Jackie and all the other innocent victims of violent crime. I am honored to support the President because he is supporting us,” he adds. “I know he will never stop fighting for justice, for law and order, and for peace and security in our communities.”

10:05 PM: Lara Trump says never in a million years did she think she would be on that stage tonight or with the last name Trump. She talks about meeting the Trumps for the first time: “Any preconceived notion I had of this family disappeared immediately. They were warm and caring, they were hard workers, and they were down to earth. They reminded me of my own family. They made me feel like I was home.”

She also testifies about seeing so many women executives in the Trump organization.

“So, it didn’t surprise me when President Donald Trump appointed the most women to senior level positions of any administration in history. The Secretary of the United Nations, Secretary of the Air Force, the first female CIA Director, the first African American female director of the Fish and Wildlife service and countless ambassadors, just to name a few,” she says. “Under President Trump’s leadership women’s unemployment hit the lowest level since World War II. 4.3 million new jobs have been created for women — in 2019 alone, women took over 70% of those new jobs. Female small business ownership remains at an all-time high. And 600,000 women have been lifted out of poverty, all since President Trump took office.”

She says Trump did this not to gain a vote or check the box but because it was the right thing to do.

She says this is an election if we decided if we “keep America America.”

In recent months, we’ve seen weak, spineless politicians cede control of our great American cities to violent mobs. Defund the police is the rallying cry for the new, radical Democrat Party. Joe Biden will not do what it takes to maintain order. To keep our children safe in our neighborhoods and in their schools. To restore our American way of life,” she says. “We cannot dare to dream our biggest dreams–for ourselves or for our children –while consumed by worry about the safety of our families. President Trump is the law and order president–from our borders to our backyards.”

10:00 PM: House candidate Burgess Owens says he was raised in the South during the days of KKK and Jim Crow. He says after losing everything after his NFL career, he decided he could feel sorry for himself or get to work and he did by working as a chimney sweeper. He jabs Biden for saying you ain’t black if you don’t vote for him says that now, more than ever, “we need leaders who stand by their principles and won’t compromise their values for political opportunities. Now, more than ever, we need leaders who will stand up to the lawlessness supported by the radical left.”

C-SPAN

He says business ownership among people of color have hit record highs while Trump has been in office and he is just getting started.

“I’m running for Congress because we don’t need more career politicians. We need a few more chimney sweeps,” he says. “We need more leaders like President Trump who understand the freedoms that make up the fabric of America.”

9:57 PM: Sen. Ernst says the establishment media ignored the Iowa derechos because Iowa is still flyover country. She credits Trump for visiting Iowa and putting the devastation on the national media’s radar. She says she can’t recall a ticket that was more hostile to farmers than Obama-Biden unless you count Biden-Harris.

“The Democratic Party of Joe Biden is pushing this so-called Green New Deal. If given power, they would essentially ban animal agriculture and eliminate gas-powered cars. It would destroy the agriculture industry, not just here in Iowa, but throughout the country. When the pandemic hit, President Trump heard us in our call for assistance for our farmers. Knowing we have an ally in the White House is important.

Folks, this election is a choice between two very different paths,” she says. “Freedom, prosperity, and economic growth, under a Trump-Pence administration. Or, the Biden-Harris path. Paved by liberal coastal elites and radical environmentalist. An America where farmers are punished, jobs are destroyed, and taxes crush the middle class.”

C-SPAN

9:50 PM: Rep. Zeldin says the post-9/11 generation “huge shoes to fill following in the footsteps of veterans like those of our nation’s greatest generation who once put humanity on their shoulders and saved the world.” He speaks about how his two-week-old twin daughter went into septic shock and praise the Trump administration for supporting frontline workers with PPE.

“For our nation to be even stronger, more prosperous, safer, freer and more secure than ever before, to make our country greater than ever, we must re-elect President Trump,” he says. We are the land of the free, because of the brave, and we are the land of opportunity right now, because we have a President who wants to empower the best of who we are, to be the best of what we can be.”

9:47 PM: Chen Chuangcheng says the CCP is the enemy of humanity and is terrorizing its own people and threatening the well-being of the world.

“The US must use its values of freedom, democracy, and the rule of law, to gather a coalition of other democracies to stop the CCP’s aggression. President Trump has led on this and we need the other countries to join him in this fight. A fight for our future,” he says.

9:44 PM: Jack Brewer, a former NFL player and Democrat, says his child said “all lives matter” and he figured out what so many still have not. He rips Biden for misrepresenting Trump’s very fine people words about Charlottesville. He says he knows what racism looks like and rips the media for not giving Trump enough credit for what he has done for the black community.

9:41 PM: Madison Cawthorn discusses the car accident that left him in a wheel chair and gave him a one percent chance of surviving. He mentions George Washington, Abe Lincoln, James Madison all changed the world in their twenties.

“While the radical left wants to dismantle, defund, and destroy, Republicans, under President Trump’s leadership, want to rebuild, restore and renew,” he says. He says political forces today “want to usher in the digital dark ages, a time of information without wisdom and tribalism without truth. National leaders on the left have normalized demagoguery and a radicalized identity politics that rejects” Martin Luther King’s dream that draws people from across the world to the United States.

He says be a radical for our republic for which he stands and then, with assistance, stands.

9:33 PM: Rep. Stefanik talks about how she represents the cradle of the American revolution. She mentions the Battle of Saratoga and the Miracle on Ice on Lake Placid. She says she has lived the American Dream and talk about how she comes from a small-business family and was the first in her family to graduate from college and became the youngest Republican woman to serve in Congress.

“I am honored to support President Trump for re-election because I know that he is the only candidate who will stand up for hardworking families and protect the American Dream for future generations,” she says. “Since his first day in office, President Trump has fought tirelessly to deliver results for all Americans, despite the Democrats’ baseless and illegal impeachment sham and the media’s endless obsession with it. I was proud to lead the effort standing up for the Constitution, President Trump, and most importantly the American people. This attack was not just on the President, it was an attack on you–your voice and your vote.”

She says more women are running for Congress as Republicans because they “understand that this election is a choice between the far-left Democratic socialist agenda versus protecting and preserving the American Dream.”

9:30 PM: Michael McHale, the president of the National Association of Police Officers, says good officers need to know that their elected leaders have their backs. He says chaos results when leaders make the conscious decision not to support law enforcement. He says Biden has been taken over the by the radical left and Harris has supported legislation to further restrict police that would make America’s streets more dangerous. He makes the case that Trump-Pence is the pro-law enforcement candidate.

9:24 PM: Legendary college football coach Lou Holtz talk about his poor upbringing in a one-bedroom house in West Virginia. He says his parents taught him to never blame anyone else but there are politicians, professors, protesters, and Trump’s naysayers who like to blame others for all of their problems and don’t have pride in America.

“When I was an Army officer, I served with so many great Americans who embraced their responsibility to our country. I am so proud of their sacrifice and the opportunity it has provided for so many millions,” Holtz says. “America remains the land of opportunity no matter what the other side says or believes.”

He says Trump has his trust because he is the most pro-life president in history. Hold says the Biden-Harris ticket “is the most radically pro-abortion campaign in history. They and other politicians are Catholics in Name Only and abandon innocent lives. President Trump protects those lives.”

9:21 PM: Sister Dede Byrne talks about her untraditional journey to religious life. She joined the Army as a medical student at Georgetown in 1978 to pay for tuition and devoted 29 years to the military, serving as a doctor and surgeon in places like Afghanistan and the Sinai Peninsula.

She says that “while we tend to think of the marginalized as living beyond our borders, the truth is, the largest marginalized group in the world can be found in the United States. They are the unborn.”

“As Christians, we first met Jesus as a stirring embryo in the womb of an unwed mother and saw him born nine months later in the poverty of the cave. It’s no coincidence that Jesus stood up for what was just and was ultimately crucified because what he said wasn’t politically correct or fashionable,” she says. “As followers of Christ, we are called to stand up for life and against the politically correct or fashionable today. We must fight against a legislative agenda that supports and even celebrates destroying life in the womb. In fact, the laws we create define how we see our humanity. And we must ask ourselves, what are we saying when we go into a womb and snuff out a powerless, voiceless life.

She continues: “As a physician, I can say unequivocally life begins at conception. While what I have to say may be difficult for some to hear, I am saying it because I’m not just pro-life, I’m pro-eternal life and I want all of us to end up in heaven together some day.”

She says she is here because Trump is the most pro-life president the country has ever seen while Biden-Harris is the most anti-life ticket ever.

9:05 PM: White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany talks about why she decided to get a mastectomy and how Trump called to check on her after he operation. She said she had only met Trump on a few occasions but she knows him well now.

“The same way President Trump has supported me, he supports you. I see it every day,” she says. She says she has heard Trump say the hardest part of his jobs is writing letters to the loved ones of fallen soldiers.

McEnany where says Trump will fight for an America where “God is cherished” and “not taken out of our schools, removed from our Pledge, and erased from our history.”

8:58 PM: Next up is Tera Myers to talk about education freedom and her child with Down’s Syndrome. She says she is thankful Trump values the life of the unborn. She says Trump did not dismiss her son and showed him he valued him and gave him an equal seat at the table. She thanks Trump for their work on education freedom.

8:52 PM: Ret. Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg says Trump only cares about what is “right for America” when making foreign policy decisions.

“When President Donald Trump took office, decades of failed foreign policy had crippled us. He faced wars without end in sight, creation of failed states like Libya and Syria, a past that allowed a terrorist caliphate to grow, and leadership in Washington that allowed our military to atrophy while we spent trillions of dollars abroad instead of investing at home,” Kellogg says. “President Trump has reversed the decline of our military and restructured our national security strategy. With historic investment and vision, our military is now better equipped, better resourced and better manned than any military in the world.”

Kellogg also says Trump “demolished the terrorist ISIS caliphate in the Middle East and eliminated its leader, al-Baghdadi, one of the world’s most brutal murderers” while taking “decisive action against Iranian terrorist mastermind Qasim Soleimani—a man responsible for the deaths of hundreds of American servicemen in Iraq.”

He also says Trump is no hawk, wisely wielding the sword when required and believing in seeking peace instead of perpetual conflict. He then praises Trump’s peace deal between Israel and the United Arab Emirates. He says this week, Afghan officials will start peace negotiations with the Taliban to end America’s longest war.

8:49 PM: Rep. Crenshaw says America has a long history of “duty” and “our enemies fear us because Americans fight for good, and we know it gives us strength. And when our heroes are trusted and equipped, then freedom prevails.”

He talks about the defeat of ISIS and the cowering of Iran being the result of America believing in heroes and her might.

“America is a fabric woven from the threads of history’s best stories, best attributes, and greatest ideas. The American spirit reflects the oldest and most important virtues: self-sacrifice, courage, tolerance, love of country, grace, and passion for human achievement,” Crenshaw says. “We can decide right now that American greatness will not be rejected nor squandered. As the American founding was grounded in individual liberty, so will be our future.”

8:43 PM: Sen. Blackburn says America is a nation of heroes and, in times of difficulties we’re reminded that they are all around us. She says she wants to talk about another type of hero, the types Democrats don’t want to recognize because they don’t fit into their narratives–law enforcement officers.

“Leftists try to turn them into villains. They try to ‘cancel’ them. But I’m here to tell you that these heroes can’t be cancelled.

Tennessee is full of them—after all, we’re the volunteer state,” she says before saying her dad served in the Army in WWII.

“I’m reminded of him whenever I see compassion and selflessness in others,” she says. “When I see law enforcement officers put their lives on the line every single day to keep our communities safe, in spite of the hatred thrown at them. When I see the heroes who volunteer to serve our country, putting their lives on the line for our freedom.”

She says the common thread between them is that they don’t believe the country owes them anything; they believe they owe their country.

“As hard as Democrats try, they can’t cancel our heroes. They can’t contest their bravery, and they can’t dismiss the powerful sense of service that lives deep in their souls,” she says. “So they try to defund them —our military, our police, even ICE — to take away their tools to keep us safe.”

Blackburn says Biden and Harris and their “radical allies try to destroy these heroes, because if there are no heroes to inspire us—government can control us.”

“They close our churches, but keep the liquor stores and abortion clinics open. They say we can’t gather in groups at church, but encourage protests, riots, and looting in the streets,” she says before adding that if Democrats had their way, “they would keep you locked in your house until you become dependent on the government for everything.”

In 47 years in Washington, Joe Biden hasn’t done anything for the timber industry.”

She says our founding principles are under attack and this election is between a man who believes in these ideals and someone who doesn’t and hasn’t built anything. After citing James Madison extensively, she says Americans will not be a subclass of experts. Noem rips the violence of the mobs and says the people who can’t afford to flee are left to fend for themselves.

“From Seattle and Portland to Washington and New York, Democrat-run cities across this country are being overrun by violent mobs. The violence is rampant. There’s looting, chaos, destruction, and murder. People that can afford to flee have fled. But the people that can’t, Good, hard-working Americans are left to fend for themselves,” she says. “The Republican Party’s commitment to individual rights and self-government is as necessary today as it was in 1860 when we won our first presidential election.”

623,http://www.breitbart.com/africa/2020/08/27/nigerian-senator-boko-haram-massacred-75-elders-in-my-hometown-i-cant-go-home/,2020-08-27T00:00:00,breitbart,"Senator Ali Ndume of Borno state, Nigeria, lamented in remarks Wednesday that he does not feel safe returning to his hometown because Boko Haram’s ongoing conquest of the region is “overwhelming” to security officers.

Boko Haram, a jihadist organization that swore allegiance to the Islamic State in 2015, was founded in northeast Borno state and has expanded its activities throughout northern Nigeria and the Lake Chad region that includes parts of Chad and Cameroon. Reports throughout the year have indicated that the group has expanded activities this year, massacring entire villages and recruiting terrorists among the desperate internally displaced people living in government-organized camps, many of which cannot go home precisely because of Boko Haram.

Senator Ndume recalled that Boko Haram massacred 75 village elders in his hometown, Gwoza, Borno, and that survivors have little attachment to the government or access to basic resources like good.

Ndume was speaking in Maiduguri, the capital city of Boron, at a Senate local commission meeting, Nigeria’s Premium Times newspaper reported.

“Even as a serving senator, I still cannot go to Gwoza my home town because it is not safe,” Ndume said. “Our security operatives are trying their bests, and we have to give it to them. But the situation is overwhelming. People are dying every day, either from attacks or by hunger. We have lost many lives here.”

“There was a time in my home town Gwoza, that about 75 elders most of whom I know personally were dragged by Boko Haram to the town’s abattoir and slaughtered like animals. Only two persons survived because their bodies were covered with other people’s’ blood and the assailants thought they were dead,” Ndume recalled. “In the same Gwoza, Boko Haram had in a single day lined up young men and summarily shot them dead. These were just some stand out cases.” Ndume did not say when the massacre occurred. Many Boko Haram attacks go unreported because of how remote “People die every day here, and I can assure you that even today or this evening, someone may have died of hunger. I am not talking about children – I mean adults,” Ndume said, crediting unnamed NGOs with offering humanitarian aid that the government could not provide.

Ndume’s plea to the Nigerian government to act more definitively against Boko Haram – a terrorist group President Muhammadu Buhari has claimed he defeated repeatedly since 2015 – came less than a week after the governor of Borno, Babagana Zulum, warned that terrorists were entering camps hosting internally displaced people (IDP) and recruiting new jihadis.

“Truly, the Boko Haram terrorists are working on people to join them in the ongoing war,” Zulum said. “If IDPs living in camps and host communities are not given the opportunity to return to their communities to resume farming, they may be forced to join Boko Haram.”

The greater Borno area is home to nearly 2 million IDPs; Boko Haram is believed to have displaced nearly 9 million people in the Lake Chad region, according to Nigeria’s the Guardian. Those in the camps endure notoriously dire conditions, including unsanitary conditions, lack of food, and abuse by officials running the camps. A 2016 report revealed evidence that police and Nigerians soldiers were raping the people in the camps, many of them women and girls who had been rescued from sex slavery under Boko Haram. Some reported being raped, while others said they endured forced sexual relations with soldiers in exchange for food.

In 2017, the Nigerian military bombed a Boko Haram refugee camp, allegedly accidentally.

In addition to fears of recruitment, local officials have documented multiple Boko Haram attacks throughout the month. Last week, Boko Haram terrorists reportedly killed three Nigerian soldiers and took hundreds of civilian hostages in Kukawa, a town in Borno, leaving it devastated.

“The terrorists on 18 August 2020 attacked troops’ location in Kukawa town in Borno state where the attack was vehemently thwarted,” defense spokesman John Enenche said at time, insisting Kukawa was “calm.”

In July, Boko Haram jihadists published a video in which they executed five local humanitarian aid workers.

The Church of the Brethren in Nigeria (EYN), which operates in Boko Haram territory, estimated in July that the group had launched at least 50 attacks on local communities throughout 2020. The high number of attacks corresponded with warnings earlier in the year from the Christian charity Open Doors that the Chinese coronavirus pandemic was helping Boko Haram, letting the jihadis fill the void where police authority had been.

“Boko Haram and its splinter groups are opportunistically expanding into the void of governance left when all attention and resources are focused on containing the coronavirus,” David Curry, the CEO of Open Doors, said in April.

After Boko Haram declared allegiance to the Islamic State in 2015, it rebranded as the “Islamic State West Africa Province” (ISWAP). Nigerian officials, including Buhari, have justified their claims that Boko Haram is defeated by claiming that ISWAP is an offshoot of Boko Haram, not run by original Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau, who allegedly did not agree to becoming a subsidiary of a foreign group. The Nigerian government has repeatedly claimed to have killed Shekau, only for him to resurface in propaganda videos.

Police arrested Prince Dubeko Sibanda, who serves as a Member of Parliament (MP) and MDC Alliance Matabeleland North chairman, in the city of Bulawayo for distributing face masks inscribed “#ZanuPFMustGo,” a reference to the left-wing party formerly led by late Robert Mugabe that still rules Zimbabwe by decree.

According to The New Zimbabwe, Sibanda announced his arrest on the party’s WhatsApp group.

“I am currently at the Bulawayo Law and Order where I have been called for an interview on allegations of distributing face masks inscribed #zanupfmustgo,” he wrote.

Sibanda’s lawyer, Nqobani Sithole, also confirmed his arrest to the Zimbabwean daily.

“Yes, Hon. Sibanda has been arrested. He is currently at the Bulawayo Law and Order. He is facing charges of inciting public violence,” Sithole said.

The arrest is the latest example of political repression at the hands of Emmerson Mnangagwa’s socialist regime. Also this month, police arrested journalist Hopewell Chin’ono and Jacob Ngarivhume, the leader of the Transform Zimbabwe political party, on charges of urging people to “participate in public violence” after they encouraged people to join anti-government protests against the Mnangagwa regime. Human rights groups say the two men have since been kept in leg shackles, deprived of food and medical treatment, and stripped of their constitutional rights.

After seizing power following the removal of Mugabe in 2017, Mnangagwa was “re-elected” the following year in elections denounced by many international observers as neither free nor fair. Having promised to reform Zimbabwe after years of repression and economic catastrophe, Mnangagwa has ended up governing in very much the same style as his predecessor, overseeing egregious human rights abuses, and continued financial meltdown.

Last year, a United Nations report warned that the country was on the brink of “man-made starvation” as a result of Mnangagwa’s policies. The New York-based NGO Human Rights Watch outlined in its 2019 report on the country that despite Mnangagwa insisting upon his commitment to human rights reforms, Zimbabwe remained “highly intolerant of basic rights, peaceful dissent, and free expression in 2019.”

“During nationwide protests in mid-January, following the president’s sudden announcement of a fuel price increase, security forces responded with lethal force,” the organization noted. “In the months that followed, several civil society activists, political opposition leaders, and other critics of the government were arbitrarily arrested, abducted, beaten, or tortured. Little to no efforts were made to bring those responsible for the abuses to justice.”

The new border structures will dwarf the current fencing around the two Spanish cities on the North African coast, which is around 10 feet tall and topped with barbed wire.

Despite these existing barriers, both Ceuta and Melilla — just across the sea from the Spanish mainland on the borders of Morocco — have seen many migrants storm the border in recent years.

1,000 African Migrants Armed with Improvised Spears Storm Spanish Border https://t.co/DaJMjDEeaa — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) August 9, 2017

According to a report from Italian newspaper Il Giornale, the new walls will not be topped with barbed wire, in order to prevent injury of migrants who do make it to the top of the wall. But a steel cylinder will be placed at the top to make it harder for migrants to get over.

The project comes after around 300 migrants stormed the enclave of Melilla on Thursday morning. According to local security forces, the attack started at around 6 a.m. and around 50 migrants broke into the Spanish — and, by extension, European Union — territory.

The migrants, according to the authorities, were mainly from sub-Saharan Africa. They said it was just the latest incident in which migrants attacked the border this year, despite the coronavirus pandemic, with a group of around 250 making an attempt in April.

Since January an estimated 11,460 migrants have arrived in Spanish territory via various routes, with many arriving in the Canary Islands off north-west Africa via boat.

While illegal migration is down overall due to the pandemic, the islands, popular with British tourists and expats, have seen a 454 per cent increase in arrivals compared to the same period in 2019.

According to a number of local sources, a large battalion of militants of the Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP) terror group, a splinter group of Boko Haram, stormed the town of Kukawa (Borno State) in trucks late Tuesday.

Local anti-jihadist militia head Babakura Kolo said that the terrorists “attacked the town in 22 trucks around 4:00pm” and proceeded to open fire on soldiers who were guarding the town.

“We don’t know what they would do to them but I hope they don’t harm them,” said a local chief, who asked to remain anonymous.

Many of the hundreds abducted had recently been resettled in the town after spending some two years in displacement camps where they had fled following a similar attack in November 2018. They had been housed in camps in Maiduguri, some 120 miles away until just over two weeks ago.

One security source said that fighter jets had been deployed from Maiduguri on Wednesday to “tackle the situation,” and the Nigerian army announced Thursday that it was now in “full control” of the town.

“The terrorists on 18 August 2020 attacked troops’ location in Kukawa town in Borno state where the attack was vehemently thwarted,” said defense spokesman John Enenche in a statement, noting that troops had killed eight of the jihadists during the confrontation.

“The situation in Kukawa is now calm with troops in full control,” he said.

Boko Haram’s insurgency in Nigeria’s northeast region began in 2009 when the group vowed to establish a caliphate in Nigeria based on fundamentalist Islamic law. The jihadist group has killed some 30,000 during its 10-year campaign mainly in northeastern Nigeria.

According to security sources, ISWAP — which broke off from Boko Haram — is seeking to build up its influence in the Lake Chad region, where Kukawa is located.

Though they have been driven back by the military over the past few years, Boko Haram and ISWAP are still active in terrorizing parts of northeast Nigeria and in border areas in Cameroon, Chad, and Niger.

The ongoing assault from Islamist militants has driven some 2 million people from Nigeria’s northeast, many of whom have moved to IDP camps in Maiduguri, the capital of Borno State.

The United Nations said last week that 10.6 million of the 13 million people in the states of Borno, Adamawa, and Yobe would require humanitarian assistance this year due to the ongoing conflict aggravated by the coronavirus pandemic.

Sudan’s foreign ministry spokesman Haydar Sadiq told Sky News Arabia on Tuesday that Sudan “aspires towards a peace agreement with Israel… a relationship of equals built upon Khartoum’s interests.” Continuing, Sadiq said, “There’s no reason for the enmity to continue…We do not deny the communication between the two countries.”

“Both Sudan and Israel will benefit from such an agreement if it is signed, at the end of this year or the beginning of next year,” the spokesman said, referring to Israeli Intelligence Minister Eli Cohen’s remarks over the weekend that he believes Sudan and Israel will agree to a peace deal by the end of 2020.

“There will be, this year, an additional [agreement] with an African country, in my estimation Sudan, that will also sign a peace agreement with the State of Israel,” Cohen said in an interview with Israeli media. Cohen’s prediction followed news on August 13 that Israel and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) would normalize diplomatic relations between them.

Sadiq said on Tuesday that he confirmed talks between Sudan and Israel because no senior Sudan government officials had publicly addressed Cohen’s comments on a future Sudan-Israel peace agreement. Sadiq confirmed his comments to Reuters later on Tuesday, according to the news agency, describing the UAE’s decision to normalize relations with Israel as “a brave and bold step.”

Sudanese Foreign Minister Omar Qamar al-Din Ismail denied Sadiq’s comments on Tuesday night, however, saying the government was “surprised” by Sadiq’s claim that Sudan and Israel had engaged in peace talks.

Sudan’s foreign ministry fired Sadiq hours later on Wednesday, the Sudanese state news agency SUNA reported, according to Reuters.

“The Foreign Ministry was surprised to see the statements of Ambassador Haider Badawi Sadiq, the ministry’s spokesman, about Sudan’s attempt to establish relations with Israel. These statements have created an ambiguous situation that needs clarification,” Sudanese Foreign Minister Ismail said in a statement on Tuesday night. “The matter of relations with Israel has not been discussed in the Foreign Ministry at all.

Keita took office in 2013 promising that the days of mutinies, coups, and juntas were over, but in the end, he was overthrown by one of the swiftest coups in recent history.

The president was supported by Western governments, most notably France, which has struggled against tribalism and the rise of Islamic extremism in the Sahel region around the Sahara Desert for years. When Keita took office, France moved counter-terrorism forces into the region while the European Union worked on training the Malian army into a more disciplined and formidable fighting force. Jihadi organizations, including the Islamic State and al-Qaeda, continued building their strength in the Sahel throughout the past decade.

Political unrest in Mali this year included accusations that French troops stationed in Mali were engaging in “rowdy behavior” and indulging in “excesses” in the red-light districts of Mali’s capital Bamako, as Malian Ambassador to France Toumani Djime Diallo put it.

“It makes people afraid, it makes tongues wag,” Diallo said in February. French military and government officials denied the accusations of misbehavior.

Keita was re-elected to a second term in 2018, but allegations of corruption and incompetence dogged his administration, and he found a potent populist adversary in Muslim cleric Mahmoud Dicko. Dicko rallied gigantic crowds in the streets despite the coronavirus pandemic, beginning in Bamako and spreading to other cities. Keita’s officials found it necessary to negotiate with Dicko even before they tried working out a deal with their elected political opponents.

Dicko is seen as an Islamic “conservative” and mystic — among other positions, he views homosexuality as a disease Mali caught from contact with the decadent West — but not a hardline fundamentalist or jihadi. He faulted Keita for allowing too much Western influence on Malian culture, and for doing a poor job of negotiating with the Sahel jihadi groups.

Meanwhile, the secular opposition to Keita railed against him for allowing the economy to collapse and doing a poor job of holding terrorists at bay. The opposition first demanded Keita cede some power to a “unity government,” then began demanding his resignation after botched parliamentary elections, rising allegations of corruption, the suspicious disappearance of an opposition leader, a teachers’ strike, and photos of Keita’s son partying on a yacht while the economy collapsed.

When he was elected, Keita pledged that “Kati will no longer scare Bamako,” a reference to the Kati military base outside the capital city from which the previous coup occurred. Seven years later, another coup boiled out of the Kati base.

Mutinous soldiers drove through Bamako on Tuesday firing their stolen weapons in the air, rolled through cheering crowds of anti-government protesters, set the justice ministry on fire, took Keita and his prime minister hostage, and demanded the entire government resign. Keita complied with their demands a few hours later, after his captors ignored demands from the African Union and United Nations to unconditionally release him.

“Today, certain parts of the military have decided that intervention was necessary. Do I really have a choice? Because I do not wish blood to be shed,” Keita said in a televised statement announcing his resignation.

Keita declared he was additionally dissolving the government and parliament, as demanded by the mutineers.

“May Allah help and bless Mali. I don’t feel any hatred,” he concluded.

Man-on-the-street interviews in Bamako revealed a mixture of surprise at the speed of the coup and apathy over Keita’s fate. “We did not expect this at all. It was a surprise for everyone. But since yesterday morning, in any case the population had abandoned the president,” one Bamako resident told Reuters.

On the other hand, most of the international and intra-African community condemned the coup. The West African umbrella organization ECOWAS effectively blockaded Mali, the European Union declared the coup “can in no way be a response to the deep sociopolitical crisis that has hit Mali for several months,” and counter-terrorist agencies braced for the awful security situation in the Sahel to get even worse.

“We are following with concern the development of the situation today in Mali. The US opposes any unconstitutional change of government, whether by those on the streets or by the defense and security forces,” said U.S. special envoy Dr. J. Peter Pham on Tuesday.

The next step for the coup plotters is uncertain. Leaders of the mutinous troops insisted they would hold elections and transition to a civilian government after a “reasonable delay,” but they also set up a “National Committee for the Salvation of the People” that looks a good deal like a junta.

Bloomberg News judged it unlikely that ECOWAS will be able to force Keita back into office or accept a transitional government led by anyone in his political orbit. Dicko’s populist Islamist movement, which calls itself M5-RFP or the “June 5 Movement,” will probably demand a seat at the table when any new government is formed. France and the rest of the European Union will not relish the idea of sinking into a quagmire by attempting to impose a civilian government.",President of Mali Resigns After Kidnapping By Mutinous Troops,fake

The Islamic militants, carrying AK-47 rifles and explosives, detonated a car bomb outside Lido beach in Mogadishu Sunday afternoon before storming the Elite Hotel and taking hostages.

After a siege lasting around five hours, Somalia Special Forces reclaimed the hotel and killed the five gunmen, rescuing around 200 guests via ropes strung from hotel windows.

Among those rescued was the hotel owner and the country’s former finance minister, Abdullahi Mohamed Nor. The hotel is often frequented by government officials, civil servants, and members of the Somali Jewish community.

“May Allah have mercy on all those who died in the attack by the terrorists on civilians particularly on Elite Hotel in which I was in,” Nor posted on Facebook after the attack.

Hours later, Al-Shabaab militants launched a separate assault on an army base in south-west Somalia, killing five soldiers:

Somalian President Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed said the attacks were an attempt to delay the troubled country’s recovery.

“The main objective of this terror attack is to frustrate the Somali people who are recovering from difficult circumstances,” he said on Sunday. “Their plan is to hurt every Somali.”

The incident raises further questions about the strength of the Al-Shabaab group, which has sought to violently overthrow Somalia’s elected government over the past decade and continues to control large swathes of the countryside.

Their most common method of action is through insurgent terror attacks, which the military has found difficult to prevent, despite receiving additional support from the U.S. and the African Union, comprising of troops from Ethiopia, Kenya, Uganda, Djibouti, and Burundi.

“This attack was clearly intended to cause maximum casualty on innocent civilians—men, women, and children,” said Francisco Madeira, the head of African Union troops in Somalia, in the wake of the attack.

The number of Al-Shabaab attacks has spiked in recent months, posing fresh challenges for the troubled country. As well as the terror threat, Somalia has also seen flash floods affecting over one million people, swarms of locusts have eaten up large portions chunks of its harvest, and the major challenge faced by the Chinese coronavirus outbreak.

Cape Verde is a nation located off the coast of West Africa comprised of ten tiny islands. Rikiya and Ayumi Kataoka were honeymooning there when the Chinese coronavirus pandemic hit and cut off travel to and from the islands five months ago.

With many international flights suspended, the couple were unable to resume their planned journey from Cape Verde to Europe and then home to Japan. They were also unwilling to fly to the African mainland, where coronavirus cases were surging. Left with little choice, the newlyweds remained on the island.

With their funds dwindling and unable to secure work visas, the enterprising couple traded their skills in videography and blogging to local establishments in exchange for lodging and food. The couple’s successful relationship with locals soon caught the attention of Cape Verde Olympic officials, who this week asked Rikiya and Ayumi to represent their team as ambassadors next summer in the rescheduled Tokyo Olympics.

“They want me to be an ambassador of the Olympic team,” Rikiya, 30, told Reuters on Wednesday. He spoke to the news agency from the Cape Verde island of Sal via Zoom. “When I go back to Tokyo, I will do a job for them.”

Leonardo Cunha, Cape Verde’s chef de mission for Tokyo, said the islands “felt the urge of giving back” to the couple.

“The guys are Japanese citizens and they deserve, in the name of the friendship we have with Japan, just to be well-treated,” he said.

“It was our interest to accompany them on their journey as well (and) making them part of our adventure in Japan,” Cunha added.

Over the past five months, Rikiya and Ayumi have filmed promotional videos and written reviews for Cape Verde hotels and restaurants, promoting their businesses online.

“I shot many things in restaurants and hotels, as a volunteer,” Rikiya said, adding that he had approached the local businesses for job offers.

Germany offered €10 million ($11.7 million) in reparations for mass killings the German Empire committed at the beginning of the 20th century. Namibian President Hage Geingob rejected the offer, insisting his government’s special envoy, Zed Ngavirue, would negotiate for a “revised offer.”

“The current offer for reparations made by the German government remains an outstanding issue and is not acceptable to the Namibian government,” Geingob said in a statement after a briefing on the status of negotiations.

Geingob also took exception over Berlin’s refusal to use the term reparations, describing it instead as “healing the wounds” of the past.

“While the Namibian Government agreed to negotiate the issue of redress (reparations), which the German Government consistently referred to as ‘healing the wounds,’ Germany has declined to accept the term ‘reparations,'” he continued.

The two countries opened negotiations on an agreement over the issue in 2015. The Namibian government sought to convince Germany to officially apologize for the killing of tens of thousands of indigenous Herero and Nama people between 1904 and 1908 in response to an anti-colonial uprising.

Germany has repeatedly evaded the issue, refusing to issue an unreserved apology despite its admission that colonial authorities were responsible for the atrocities. Berlin is also reluctant to pay direct reparations, instead pointing to the tens of millions it has provided the country in development aid.

According to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, German colonial officials killed as many as 80,000 people.

The Museum noted:

Between 1904-1907, German military forces, called Schutztruppe, committed a genocide against indigenous people in their colony of German Southwest Africa (present-day Namibia; hereafter, GSWA). The intent of these killings—which occurred through battle; through starvation and thirst in the Omaheke Desert; and through forced labor, malnutrition, sexual violence, medical experiments and disease in concentration camps—was to rid the colony of people viewed as expendable and thus gain access to their land. This genocide, the first of the twentieth century, was a prelude to the Holocaust in both the ideology of racial hierarchy that justified the genocide and in the methods employed. Such linkage between the two genocides has been termed the “continuity thesis.” Historians estimate that approximately 80,000 indigenous people were killed in the genocide. While these numbers are difficult to confirm, this figure represents about 80 percent of the Herero people and 50 percent of the Nama people.

Germany’s special envoy and chief negotiator, Ruprecht Polenz, did not deny that Namibia rejected the offer but insisted he was confident the two sides could reach a satisfactory agreement.

“What matters is that the negotiations are ongoing, and I am still optimistic that a solution can be found,” he said. “Germany wants to live up to its moral and political responsibility. For us, this is not a legal question but a political and moral question.”

Castex bowed his head before the six coffins draped in blue aligned in a special room at Orly airport in a simple, solemn ceremony for those killed last Sunday along with two others at a reserve for giraffes, 70 kilometers (45 miles) from their base in the capital, Niamey.

The six worked for Paris-based ACTED, another victim for the Swiss-based Impact International and the eighth was an expert guide.

Their deaths are “the incarnation of evil,” Castex said.

“It’s very probably the same hate in Niger as at the Bataclan,” he said. The attack claimed by the Islamic State group on the Paris music hall and nearby restaurants five years ago killed 130 people.

It is not known who killed the unarmed humanitarian workers, but the French prosecutors’ office opened a terrorism-linked investigation and Castex said terrorism was the likely motive.

French investigators went to Niger to help in the probe and Castex promised the killers would be “relentlessly tracked.”

“All of France grieves for its children,” the prime minister said in his homage at what was described as a national ceremony with two ministers at his side.

The head of another well-known humanitarian group, Pierre Micheletti of Action Against Hunger, took exception to what appeared to him an effort to officially link those killed in Niger with the French state, insisting that the victims did not represent France.

If they are seen as representatives of the state, “this exposes us tomorrow,” he said in an interview ahead of the ceremony on CNews television, stressing that aid workers represent international humanitarian law.

“To hold up the idea that volunteers represent France is to expose us tomorrow to other security dramas,” he said, adding that with that image it would not be possible to send volunteers in the future to places where France is politically or militarily engaged.

During their raid, the Islamists vandalized church property and also torched an automobile and a nearby building, according to a statement by state police spokesman Asinim Butswat.

Mr. Butswat said that police currently believe that the attack may have been an act of retaliation for pressure on the Islamists by “Operation Puff Adder,” a special task force launched in 2019 to combat violent crimes in the country, especially banditry and kidnapping.

“The agents of operation Puff Adder had previously traced the radicals to their hideouts in the bush, dislodging them and burning their camp,” he said in the statement. “It is believed to be a retaliatory attack by the presumed sectarians.”

“In the meantime, two suspects have been arrested and are cooperating with the police in the investigation,” he said.

Butswat said that the State Police Commissioner of Bayesla, Mike Okoli, had visited the scene, reassuring community members of police protection and ordering a full investigation into the attack.

Three weeks ago, two thieves were shot dead in a church in South Africa. The men had held up the congregation who were present for services but were foiled in the attempted robbery by one of the faithful, Pieter van der Westhuizen, who was also armed and gunned the men down.

“The port of Mocimboa da Praia was captured by the terrorists at dawn,” local news website Moz24Horas reported, as quoted by Agence France-Presse (AFP). The port seizure followed days of fighting between Mozambique military forces and the terrorists in Mocimboa da Praia, after which naval forces “ran out of ammunition to keep insurgents at bay,” local news site Zitamar reported, as quoted by Reuters.

The port facilitates key cargo deliveries to major natural gas projects located just 37 miles north of Mocimboa da Praia worth an estimated $60 billion. One of the projects, a liquefied natural gas facility considered “one of Africa’s biggest single investment projects” is located on nearby Afungi Peninsula, according to AFP.

Wednesday’s port seizure marked the latest of several attacks on the town this year by a local militant group loyal to Islamic State.

“The group, known as Ahlu Sunnah Wa-Jama, pledged allegiance to Islamic State last year, and IS subsequently began claiming the local group’s attacks, including another strike on Mocimboa da Praia earlier this year,” Reuters reported.

The Islamic State claimed responsibility for violent seizures of military bases near Mocimboa da Praia that killed an unknown number of Mozambique soldiers. The terrorists captured weaponry including machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades during the takeovers.

On Monday, the Kano Upper Sharia (Islamic law) Court in the state’s Hausawa Filin Hockey area sentenced 22-year-old Yahaya Sharif to death by hanging. Sharif was found guilty of blasphemy by the sharia law court for a song he circulated via the WhatsApp messaging app in March.

According to the BBC, critics said Sharif’s song was blasphemous because it praised an imam (religious leader) from the singer’s Islamic sect – the Tijaniya Muslim brotherhood – exalting him above Muhammad, regarded as the greatest of all prophets in Islam.

After Sharif’s song went viral online for its allegedly blasphemous content, violent protests erupted in his hometown of Kano, the state’s capital city. An angry mob gathered outside his family home and burned it down. The mob then reportedly marched to the Kano Hisbah (Islamic police) headquarters and demanded punitive action be taken against the singer. A state-run entity, the Hisbah enforces sharia in the state.

Sharif went into hiding after the incident and currently remains in detention, the BBC reported.

Idris Ibrahim, the leader of the violent protests against Sharif, told the BBC on Monday that the singer’s death sentence will serve as a welcome warning to others who dare to defy the region’s strict interpretation of Islam.

“When I heard about the judgment I was so happy because it showed our protest wasn’t in vain. This [judgment] will serve as a deterrent to others who feel they could insult our religion or prophet and go scot-free,” he said.

According to the New Zimbabwe, Jacob Ngarivhume and Hopewell Chin’ono are being kept in leg shackles and under constant surveillance at the Chikurubi Maximum Security Prison outside Harare. The newspaper published low-resolution photos allegedly of the pair in the shackles.

Police arrested the men last month on charges of supposedly calling on supporters to “participate in public violence” after they backed nationwide protests demanding the removal of far-leftist President Emmerson Mnangagwa’s regime. Chin’ono had recently come to prominence for his investigative work uncovering allegations of corruption concerning the procurement of coronavirus supplies by the Zimbabwean Health Ministry, prompting the health minister to resign.

Last week, the group Zimbabwe Lawyers for Human Rights (ZLHR) released a statement describing violations of the pair’s constitutional and human rights, which included being denied access to their lawyers and not being provided any food. The pair were offered sadza, a maize flour porridge made in Africa, but had to reject it for medical reasons.

“Of concern to ZLHR is the welfare of Chin’ono and Ngarivhume who have been left with no access to food as the two do not eat sadza for medical reasons but they were advised that ZPCS only serves sadza in prison,” the statement read. “Because both Chin’ono and Ngarivhume are on medication, they would need access to a balanced diet while in prison.”

Such concerns were echoed by the U.S. Embassy in Harare, calling for the men’s release.

“Denying bail and using the legal system to jail journalist Hopewell Chin’ono, Transform Zimbabwe leader Jacob Ngarivhume, and others for exercising their rights undermines democracy and freedom of speech,” the embassy wrote on Twitter.

After replacing the late dictator Robert Mugabe in 2017, Mnangagwa promised to call free and fair elections and bring in a new, more prosperous era for the troubled African country. However, the veracity of the results of the 2018 presidential election remain highly disputed after Mnangagwa claimed a convincing victory over his opponent Nelson Chamisa.

Since that election, he has continued to preside over a far-left regime largely indistinguishable from his predecessor, responsible for egregious human rights abuses and a major economic and humanitarian crisis exacerbated by the Chinese coronavirus pandemic. Last November, the United Nations warned in a report the country was on the brink of “man-made starvation” as a result of major food shortages caused by high unemployment, rampant corruption, and hyperinflation.

The situation on the ship has become much more tense in recent days as more migrants have arrived, many testing positive for the Wuhan virus.

The ship took over from the Moby Zaza ferry as a quarantine vessel earlier this month. 350 migrants were transferred to the vessel from Lampedusa, 12 of which have tested positive for the virus, Il Giornale reports.

As the vessel was sailing from Lampedusa to Trapani, where it will remain off the coast of Sicily, a group of Tunisian migrants protested and held a small revolt, allegedly suspicious they were being taken back to a port in Tunisia.

According to Il Giornale, the incident is just the latest of a number of small revolts that took place aboard the Moby Zaza as it was being used to quarantine migrants.

The migrants aboard the Azzurra are said to be mostly from Tunisia, with a small number of migrants from sub-Saharan Africa. While most are adult males, there are also some families aboard and ten unaccompanied youths.

The quarantine of the migrants aboard the vessels, which began in May, is estimated to be costing around 4,000 euros per migrant per month.

The programme has been criticised by members of Matteo Salvini’s League (Lega) party, such as Alessandro Pagano, who decried the costs as many Italians were struggling due to the coronavirus pandemic.

Despite the pandemic and the various lockdown measures put in place by the Italian government, the country has seen a surge in new migrant arrivals in the last several weeks, to the point that many areas, such as Lampedusa, are completely full.

In a statement Sunday, the Zimbabwe Lawyers for Human Rights (ZLHR) claimed that Jacob Ngarivhume and Hopewell Chin’ono were being deprived of their constitutional rights.

“Zimbabwe Lawyers for Human Rights (ZLHR) is concerned about the treatment of freelance journalist Hopewell Chin’ono and Jacob Ngarivhume, the leader of Transform Zimbabwe political party, who are currently detained at Chikurubi Maximum Prison,” the statement read.

According to the group, the pair were moved to a different facility on Friday where they were “trip searched and shackled in leg irons.” No authorities informed their families or their lawyers about the transfer.

“Of concern to ZLHR is the welfare of Chin’ono and Ngarivhume who have been left with no access to food as the two do not eat sadza for medical reasons but they were advised that ZPCS only serves sadza in prison,” it continued. “Because both Chin’ono and Ngarivhume are on medication, they would need access to a balanced diet while in prison.”

The two men also reportedly requested warm clothes through their lawyers but did not receive them:

ZLHR also learnt that Chin’ono and Ngarivhume were not provided with jerseys while in detention as prison officers advised that they did not have any more jerseys in stock. Although the two prisoners’ lawyers sought permission to bring in warm clothes as ZPCS has no jerseys, this request was turned down with prison officers insisting that only the red and white prison jersey is allowed and that lawyers have to source the jerseys for the clients.

Chin’ono and Ngarivhume were arrested last month on charges of supposedly urging people to “participate in public violence” after they supported nationwide protests calling to overthrow President Emmerson Mnangagwa’s regime. Chin’ono had recently risen to prominence as an investigative journalist uncovering allegations of corruption concerning the procurement of coronavirus supplies by the country’s health ministry.

“The blatant and malicious stripping away of the two prisoners’ basic rights including the right to give instructions to lawyers of their choice in private is unconstitutional,” the statement added. “The harsh treatment of Chin’ono and Ngarivhume undermines the presumption of innocence.”

Having promised to introduce major reforms following the removal of Robert Mugabe in 2017, Mnangagwa has continued to preside over a far-left regime known for its egregious human rights abuses and a major economic and humanitarian crisis. Last November, a United Nations report warned that the country was on the brink of “man-made starvation,” a situation exacerbated by the Chinese coronavirus pandemic.

In its summary of Zimbabwe’s human rights record, the New York-based NHO Human Rights Watch states that “despite President Emerson Mnangagwa repeatedly voicing his commitments to human rights reforms, Zimbabwe remained highly intolerant of basic rights, peaceful dissent, and free expression in 2019.”

“During nationwide protests in mid-January, following the president’s sudden announcement of a fuel price increase, security forces responded with lethal force,” the group noted. “In the months that followed, several civil society activists, political opposition leaders, and other critics of the government were arbitrarily arrested, abducted, beaten, or tortured. Little to no efforts were made to bring those responsible for the abuses to justice.”

Seven of the eight people were aid workers working in the West African country, two European aid groups said Monday.

The six French citizens and one Nigerien were working for Paris-based NGO ACTED and Geneva-based IMPACT Initiatives. The other victim was their Nigerien guide.

The NGOs condemned “in the strongest terms the senseless and barbaric killing of our colleagues and their guide.”

French prosecutors said in a statement Monday they opened an investigation for “murders in relation to a terrorist undertaking.”

Niger’s interior ministry said Sunday the attack took place in Koure, where the aid workers were visiting a giraffe reserve. Hundreds of people visit each year the protected national park that contains dense vegetation and tall trees about 70 kilometres (45 miles) southeast of the capital.

“Our colleagues have been working to support the people of Niger facing hardship, driven by values of humanity and solidarity,” the NGOs said.

The Association of Giraffe Guides of Koure also released a statement condemning the death of the president of their association, Kadri Abdou.

“We are deeply saddened and thinking of the victims and their families to whom we offer our most sincere condolences and especially to the family of Kadri, our friend. May he rest in peace,” said the statement.

One of the biggest French NGOs, ACTED has been present in Niger since 2010 and provides aid to displaced people and local populations who are particularly vulnerable due to conflicts in the region, lack of food and droughts.

A partner to ACTED, IMPACT Initiatives was first deployed in Niger in 2012. It conducts mapping programs and other projects in camps hosting displaced populations.

In a phone call on Sunday, French President Emmanuel Macron and Niger President Mahamadou Issoufou pledged to clarify the circumstances of the deadly attack by “all means,” the French presidency said.

French Foreign Affairs minister Jean-Yves Le Drian condemned the attack on Monday, saying that those responsible “will have to answer for their acts.”

The ministry’s crisis centre and the French embassy in Niger are fully mobilized to support the victims’ families, he said.

The French government has warned citizens against travelling outside Niger’s capital, Niamey, as militants linked to Boko Haram, Islamic State and al-Qaida carry out attacks across the vast West African nation. Niger borders several countries including Mali, Burkina Faso, Chad, Nigeria and Libya.

Violence by rebels linked to the IS group and al-Qaeda is on the rise in the Sahel region. France has deployed 5,100 soldiers to help fight the growing insurgency there, and a local Sahel force made up of soldiers from Mali, Niger, Burkina Faso, Chad, and Mauritania has also been fighting the extremists.

The attack, which took place at a farm, according to the Pretoria East Rekord, citing a report in the Krugersdorp News, is believed to have been perpetrated by an armed gang who were also involved in incidents at Zwartkop, Nooitgedacht, and Beyers Naudé, and are still at large.

“They demanded money and, when they could not find it, they assaulted him, searched him and took his cellphone. The suspects took the victim’s wife, 46, and his daughters, aged 15 and 11, to another room and raped them,” said police spokesman Constable Boitumelo Sehloho, in comments quoted by News24.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 23, 2018

The issue of attacks on South African farms is long-running and highly contentious, with some reports claiming farming in the country is the most deadly occupation in the world outside of active warfighting, and others claiming farm attacks are actually falling.

The AfriForum civil rights group has disputed efforts to downplay the scale of the attacks, however, saying that the official statistics are significantly undercounting them and emphasising their often extreme brutality, with victims sometimes being tortured with implements including blowtorches and power drills.

The African National Congress (ANC) party which governs South Africa, and is currently targeting farms for expropriation without compensation — in response to political pressure from the rising Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) party led by Marxist-Leninist radical Julius Malema, according to many commentators — refuses to accept that farmers are particularly at risk, or that there is any racial animus behind the farm attacks phenomenon.

The debate gained wider prominence when U.S. President Donald Trump tweeted that he had tasked Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to “closely study the South Africa land and farm seizures and expropriations and the large scale killing of farmers” in 2018.

Armed militants attacked Borno state governor Babagana Zulum on July 29 as he traveled to the towns of Monguno and Baga to deliver food supplies to people displaced by ongoing regional turmoil. Most of the internally displaced persons (IDPs) seek refuge from violence caused by Boko Haram, a Borno State-based terrorist organization waging an ongoing campaign of jihad throughout northeastern Nigeria.

Zulum survived the ambush and said in a press interview on July 30 that he believes the perpetrators were not Boko Haram, as many assumed, but rather soldiers in the Nigerian Army.

“It is a complete sabotage … I cannot end my interview without clearly stating what happened yesterday [July 29]. As far as I am concerned, there was no Boko Haram … It was a serious shooting by the Nigerian Armed Forces while ‘residing’ in Baga. The situation is very embarrassing,” Zulum said.

The Borno State governor’s statement “underscores the disturbing security situation in Borno,” suggesting “either sabotage by some soldiers or poor communication between the soldiers in Mr. Zulum’s convoy and those on the ground in Baga who shot at the convoy,” the Premium Times observed.

Zulum questioned why the Nigerian Army forces stationed near Baga have failed to secure the town from Boko Haram attacks despite being deployed nearby for over a year.

“You have been here for over one year now, there are 1,181 soldiers here; if you cannot take over Baga which is less than 5km [3 miles] from your base, then we should forget about Baga. I will inform the [Nigerian] Chief of Army Staff to redeploy the men to other places that they can be useful,” Zulum was quoted by Nigeria’s Channels TV as saying after the attack.

In his speech on Thursday, Zulum said that Baga’s residents will be forced to organize militias to secure the town, in the absence of a meaningful military presence.

“Baga is important … We shall organize the community to take destiny into their own hands so that we can occupy Baga,” the governor said.

The Nigerian Army claims to be investigating the attack.

“The Nigerian Army wants to reassure the general public that this will be interrogated with a view to forestalling future re-occurance,” Nigerian Army spokesman Sagir Musa said on July 30.

In mid-July, at least 356 Nigerian soldiers resigned en masse from the Nigerian Army, citing “low morale” in the military’s losing battle against Boko Haram. The jihadists have taken advantage of lockdowns and restrictions on people’s movement during the Chinese coronavirus pandemic to launch a resurgence in Borno State and surrounding areas in recent months. According to U.N. estimates, Boko Haram has killed at least 36,000 people and displaced two million more in northeastern Nigeria since the jihadists began their violent insurgency in 2009.","Nigerian Governor Says Army, Not Boko Haram, Ambushed His Convoy",fake

Nigeria, Africa’s largest oil and gas producer, supplies China, the world’s largest crude oil importer, with oil shipments as a member of Beijing’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). Though it ostensibly supports the development of infrastructure and industry in developing nations, the BRI’s predatory loan structure effectively forces vulnerable nations into perilous debt traps.

Mexican oil trading firm Samano S.A. de C.V. recently wrote the NNPC “demanding a five percent reward for ‘exposing’ [China’s] alleged diversion and theft of 48 million barrels of [Nigerian] crude oil valued at over $2 billion,” according to the report.

The NNPC says “there was no stolen Nigerian crude oil anywhere in China” and has dismissed the trading firm that made the allegation as “an international crime syndicate.” Nigerian state-owned oil firm Afe Babalola said it plans to sue the company for its unsubstantiated claims and demand for a monetary reward, part of what it describes as “a failed attempt by officials of a Mexican firm to extort, intimidate, and defraud” the NNPC.

The denial comes two days after Nigeria’s transport minister insisted that the government is capable of paying China back billions of dollars in railway loans, secured through Nigeria’s BRI membership, in 20 years, Nigeria’s Premium Times reported on Sunday.

“Nigeria has the capacity to pay back for the period of 20 years at 2.8 percent,” Nigerian transport minister Rotimi Amaechi said.

As the Premium Times recalled, Nigeria’s BRI railway debt to Beijing has piled up in recent years, casting doubt on Amaechi’s claims that the government will be able to repay the loans in just two decades:

In 2017, the Nigerian government secured a $7.5 billion loan from the Chinese for the Lagos-Kano rail project. Another $1.5 billion loan was received from China for the Lagos-Ibadan rail construction. Earlier this year, the Senate approved a $22.7 billion loan request by President Muhammadu Buhari: 70 percent of the loan (about $17 billion) will be sourced from China’s EXIM Bank.

In a statement on Saturday, Amaechi praised Beijing’s lending terms, claiming China was “the only country giving out loans with a low-interest rate of 2.8 percent.”

Amaechi’s insistence that China’s loans have been favorable for Nigeria conflicts with recent data from the Center for Global Development, which found that the terms of Chinese lending were “consistently harder than World Bank terms, particularly for the poorest countries” such as Nigeria, Reuters reported.

“Chinese institutions offered fewer grants; grace periods on loans were shorter, and the weighted mean interest rate was higher – 4.14 percent compared to the World Bank’s 2.1 percent,” the study found.

According to the Overseas Development Institute, lending from China accounts for ten percent of external debt service in Nigeria.",Nigeria Insists It Did Not Lose 48 Million Barrels of Oil in China,fake

“[O]ur recent news has been awash with family members of the highest-ranking ANC politicians creaming profits off Covid19 [Chinese coronavirus] tenders,” DA leader John Steenhuisen wrote. “President’s Ramaphosa’s son, Andile Ramaphosa, landed a R6 million [$349,000] contract to modify taxis in Gauteng [province] to comply with Covid19 [coronavirus] regulations.”

In addition to the president, other leading members of the ANC have allegedly granted dubious coronavirus contracts to their spouses and children. Steenhuisen continued:

President Ramaphosa’s spokesperson, Khusela Diko’s husband, Thandisizwe Diko, landed a R125 million [$7,267,421] contract to supply PPE [personal protective equipment]. ANC secretary-General Ace Magashule’s sons, Tshepiso Magashule and Thato Magashule, landed Covid19 procurement contracts in the Free State [province] to the value of R2.7 million [$157,000]. Former cabinet minister Minister Nomvula Mokonyane daughter, Katleho Mokonyane, landed a R3 million [$174,445] PPE contract despite her company only being six months old at the time.

According to Steenhuisen, the recent revelations of corruption within the ANC are likely just “the tip of the iceberg so far,” given “the [rapid] rate at which these stories are breaking.”

“If this is what we know of the involvement of the families of high-profile ANC members, one can only imagine what the picture looks like further down the line in ANC-run provinces and municipalities where tender corruption has become the very reason to run for public office,” the opposition party leader wrote.

“[T]he lure of billions of Rands [South African currency] of emergency Covid19 [coronavirus] spending was always going to be too hard to resist, despite the president’s solemn promises in March. The rest of the world has to deal only with the coronavirus pandemic, but South Africa has to simultaneously deal with its very own epidemic of ANC corruption,” the MP lamented.

Steenhuisen referred to Ramaphosa’s vow at the beginning of South Africa’s coronavirus outbreak in March to “act very strongly against any attempts at corruption and profiteering from … the [coronavirus] crisis].”

“I have directed that special units of the National Prosecuting Authority be put together to act immediately and arrest those against who we find evidence of corruption. We will work with the judiciary to expedite cases against implicated persons and make sure the guilty go to jail,” the president claimed in a nationally televised speech on March 23.

The DA leader said the ANC’s allegedly corrupt handling of the coronavirus crisis lies in stark contrast to the opposition party’s efforts to manage emergency relief in an open and honest manner.

“Compare this to the DA-run Western Cape [province known for the port city Cape Town], where all Covid19 [coronavirus] procurement is now published online in a monthly report to ensure 100 percent transparency. The difference between the DA in government and the ANC in government could not possibly be more pronounced. It is the Capable State vs the Predator State,” Steenhuisen wrote.

South Africa’s coronavirus outbreak currently ranks as the fifth-worst in the world, although an undercounting of official cases in countries such as China, North Korea, and Iran likely skews this ranking. On July 24, one of South Africa’s top epidemiologists told scientific journal Nature that he expects the nation’s caseload to exceed one million.

“Since there are communities in South Africa where social distancing and frequent hand washing is not feasible, mainly in informal settlements, I am expecting the number of cases to rise substantially, possibly exceeding a million,” the chair of the South African health ministry’s Scientific Advisory Committee, Salim Abdool Karim, predicted.

At press time on Monday, South Africa officially recorded 511,485 cases and 8,366 deaths from the Chinese coronavirus, although health authorities suspect that the official numbers are much higher due to insufficient testing and a lack of transparency on the part of Ramaphosa’s ruling ANC party.",Opposition: South African President Getting Rich Off Coronavirus,fake

Zimbabweans had planned to peacefully protest this week against the government’s alleged corruption in its handling of funds allocated for coronavirus medical supplies and increasing poverty and hunger in the struggling nation. According to the Daily Maverik, the demonstrations were thwarted by an alleged alliance between the ruling party Zanu-PF and the Zimbabwe Republic Police (ZRP), who deployed security forces to major city streets to prevent Zimbabweans from protesting.

On Thursday, “the ZRP was out in full force” in the cities of Harare and Bulawayo.

“Streets were blocked and random searches of commuters were undertaken. Videos and photographs of the police beating passengers with sticks and arresting some were being shared on networks of human rights defenders monitoring the situation,” the newspaper noted.

The ZRP tried to “round up known human rights activists and journalists” in the cities Thursday, including Mduduzi Mathuthu, an editor of the local online publication ZimLive. Mathuthu’s “home was raided and ransacked,” the Media Institute of Southern Africa said in a statement.

The Daily Maverik confirmed Zimbabwe authorities abducted a member of its staff during Thursday’s crackdown. Tawanda Muchechiwa, an anti-government activist and research assistant for Daily Maverik writer Thandekile Moyo, “was arrested with two other activists and last seen at Bulawayo police station,” although police claimed to have no knowledge of his detention.

“Around 5 pm I received a call from Tawanda who sounded desperate and not ok [or] himself,” Moyo told the newspaper. “Asking to meet me, I asked him where he was and he was incoherent. A lawyer went to [Bulawayo] central [police station] and the ZRP denied having the three [men]. [After] the lawyer was unrelenting [in demanding to see the men the] ZRP then produced the other two [men].”

“The other two [men] allege they were arrested with Tawanda and [say] he was bundled into a different car. He is missing. The police are saying they know nothing about him,” Moyo added.

Activists arrested and detained in Zimbabwe’s overrun jails face serious health risks during their detention amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, New Zimbabwe reported Friday. Zimbabwe’s prisons and detention facilities are “often unsanitary, overcrowded, and have no running water in cells for detainees to comply with hygiene practices recommended to stem the spread of the [Chinese coronavirus] disease,” the newspaper writes.

The announcement serves as a largely symbolic gesture, as the southern African nation does not currently have the money promised. The compensation agreement stipulates that the government “issue long term bonds and jointly approach international donors with the farmers to raise funding,” Reuters reported.

Zimbabwean President Emmerson Mnangagwa “ruled out compensating for the actual land taken from the whites and given to [black] peasant farmers,” VOA noted.

“With regards to the land compensation agreement signed today, my administration reaffirms that the government of Zimbabwe does not have any obligation for compensation for acquired land,” Mnangagwa said on Wednesday. “The constitution bids us to compensate [for] all the improvements on land,” he added.

By “improvements” the president referred to “structures such as dams and buildings that the white commercial farmers made on the land,” VOA noted.

Prior to the rule of leftist dictator Robert Mugabe, Zimbabwe was known as the breadbasket of Southern Africa, producing more food than it needed and exporting the surplus.

“Starting in 2000, thousands of white Zimbabwean farmers were forced off their land by violent state-backed mobs or evicted in dubious legal judgments, supposedly to help black people marginalized under British colonial rule,” Agence France-Presse (AFP) recalled in 2018. “The farms, however, were often allocated to [then] President Robert Mugabe’s allies [with no knowledge of farming] and fell into ruin, leaving tens of thousands of rural laborers out of work and sending the economy into a tailspin as food production crashed.”

The West condemned Mugabe’s so-called reforms and punished his government’s support of violent land seizures with sanctions against Zimbabwe. Mnangagwa has vowed to compensate white farmers for the land grabs since he became president in 2017 following Mugabe’s ousting in a coup. Observers view his promises as attempts to court favor from the West so that Zimbabwe may again borrow money from international lenders.

“Zimbabwe is no longer able to borrow money from the World Bank until some of Zimbabwe’s previous debts have been resolved. In particular, the United States is demanding that Zimbabwe provide at least partial restitution for land seized from white farmers before it will approve of any further World Bank loan to Zimbabwe,” Breitbart News reported in late 2018.

In announcing the compensation on Wednesday, Mnangagwa confirmed this motive saying, “the paying of compensation was key to mending ties with the West,” according to Reuters. Zimbabwe’s government reportedly hopes the pledging of land compensation for white farmers “will attract foreign investment to improve the battered economy,” VOA noted.",Zimbabwe Agrees to Pay White Farmers $3.5 Billion (It Doesn’t Have) for Land Grabs,fake

Rep. Jan Schakowsky (D-IL) introduced the measure, dubbed the Abortion is Health Care Everywhere Act of 2020, which seeks to repeal the Helms Amendment, a provision that passed in 1973 after the Supreme Court’s landmark decision in Roe v. Wade.

Reps. Nita Lowey (D-NY); Barbara Lee (D-CA); Jackie Speier (D-CA); Ayanna Pressley (D-MA); Diana DeGette (D-CO); and Norma Torres (D-CA) joined Schakowsky as original co-sponsors of the bill.

The narrative of the abortion lobby and its political allies is that policies that block abortion are racist.

Schakowsky said in a statement:

The Helms Amendment is a policy deeply rooted in racism. It imposes our arbitrary and medically unnecessary abortion restrictions on international communities, allowing the United States to control the health care and bodily autonomy of billions Black and brown people around the world. Just like the Hyde Amendment, the Helms Amendment puts reproductive and economic freedom out of reach for women of color. But enough is enough, and both amendments must fall if we want to realize true health equity and reproductive justice.

“Comprehensive reproductive health care, including safe, legal, and accessible abortion, is a human right,” Schakowsky added.

As family and human rights organization C-Fam noted, the Helms Amendment came about by amending the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to ban U.S. funds for the promotion or provision of abortions outside of the country.

Pressley, chair of the Abortion Rights and Access Taskforce of the Pro-Choice Caucus, also said in a statement that “[a]bortion care is health care and health care is a fundamental human right.”

“For too long, anti-choice policy, including the Helms Amendment and the Hyde Amendment, has dictated who has access to critical healthcare, economic opportunity and bodily autonomy,” she continued. “We must be consistent in our calls to dismantle racist policies that perpetuate inequities and exacerbate health disparities for Black and brown people here in the United States and around the globe.”",Democrats Introduce Bill to Repeal Amendment Barring U.S. Funds to Provide Abortion Overseas,fake

“As of July 29, [health authorities] confirmed the Covid-19 [Chinse coronavirus] case total from 55 African countries has reached 874,035,” the African news outlet wrote, noting that the number marked an increase of almost 14,000 cases from the previous day.

According to AllAfrica, the number of reported coronavirus deaths across the continent “reached 18,497” on Wednesday, with the number of recovered coronavirus patients totaling 524,556.

“South Africa has the most reported cases – 459,761, with deaths numbering 7,257. Other most-affected countries include Egypt (92,947), Nigeria (41,804), Algeria (28,615), and Ghana (34,406),” the report stated.

“The [Chinese coronavirus] numbers are compiled by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University using statistics from the World Health Organization and other international institutions as well national and regional public health departments [in Africa],” AllAfrica noted.

With nearly 500,000 reported cases, South Africa now has the fifth-highest official coronavirus caseload in the world, though experts believe these numbers are distorted by rogue states such as China, Russia, and North Korea not accurately documenting their cases. Its 471,123 cases at press time on Wednesday account for more than half of the African continent’s number of coronavirus cases.

In March, South Africa’s President Cyril Ramaphosa imposed one of the world’s strictest quarantines, severely limiting people’s movement and banning gatherings in the country. In June, he eased some of South Africa’s lockdown measures, which had strangled the economy and cut off many citizens from their source of income. The number of coronavirus infections has surged since then, however, prompting Ramaphosa to reinstate a night-time curfew and an alcohol sales ban last week.

Despite the government’s repeated efforts to contain South Africa’s coronavirus outbreak, the country is now closing in on half a million cases. A top South African epidemiologist told scientific journal Nature on July 24 that he expects the number of coronavirus cases in the country to exceed one million.

“Since there are communities in South Africa where social distancing and frequent hand washing is not feasible, mainly in informal settlements, I am expecting the number of cases to rise substantially, possibly exceeding a million,” Salim Abdool Karim, the chair of the South African health ministry’s Scientific Advisory Committee, predicted.

Despite South Africa’s staggeringly high number of cases, health authorities believe the country’s true number of cases — and those of most African nations — to be much higher than officially reported, owing to the government’s lack of transparency and insufficient testing.

“The official death toll [for South Africa] stands at 6,000, but as with other [African] countries, this is likely to be an undercount,” the South African Medical Research Council told Nature on July 24.

The ruling Zanu-PF party — the party of late dictator Robert Mugabe — has panicked in response to dissidents organizing a major protest against President Emmerson Mnangagwa for July 31, arresting protest organizers and claiming that American officials were secretly behind any domestic discontent. Zimbabweans have expressed outrage for the past several months at Mnangagwa’s government for overtly participating in corruption, erupting particularly against the nation’s former health minister after his arrest for being involved in a $60 million corruption scheme.

Public unrest allowed the military to depose Mugabe in 2017 and return Mnangagwa from exile. Mnangagwa had fled the country after an internal power struggle with Mugabe’s wife, “Gucci” Grace.

Like much of Africa, the Chinese coronavirus pandemic has caught Zimbabwe’s weak healthcare infrastructure off guard, resulting in reports of health workers lacking sufficient supplies to do their jobs and suspicions that the virus is much more widespread in the national population than the low number of coronavirus tests would indicate. At press time, Zimbabwe’s government has documented 2,704 cases of Chinese coronavirus and 36 deaths.

Chinamasa unleashed on Nichols during a press conference Monday, blaming him and America for growing unrest in the country.

“Concerning the machinations and antics of the U.S. Ambassador Brian Nichols and a coterie of gangsters and mercenaries who are disguised as diplomats, I want to warn them and remind them that it is high time they get to know that Zimbabwe is a sovereign republic and we are a full sovereign State,” Chinamasa said, according to New Zimbabwe. “If he continues to undermine the republic, mobilizing, and funding disturbances coordinating violence and training in insurgency, our leadership will not hesitate to give him marching orders.”

“Diplomats should not behave like thugs and Brian Nichols is a thug,” Chinamasa added, warning “Don’t dare Zimbabwe. We are waiting for you. Zimbabwe is not one of the states or provinces that make the United States of America.”

The African outlet 263Chat added that Chinamasa claimed that Nichols was an “Uncle Tom” for representing a country that allegedly abused black people: “What has the United States has to offer in terms of values and human rights observance when his own African American people are treated like rats in full view of world media and he remains an Uncle Tom used to propagate values which, by themselves, they do not practice on their own people.”

New Zimbabwe noted that America formally summoned the Zimbabwean ambassador to Washington, Innocent Mutembwa, to issue a complaint.

“Comments from Zanu PF — while sadly not surprising — are offensive. We have summoned [the] ambassador of Zimbabwe to explain,” U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Tibor Nagy lamented.

The outburst followed Zimbabwe’s “information minister” Monica Mutsvangwa disparaging American officials for expressing opposition to the arrest of dissident organization leader Jacob Ngarivhume and journalist Hopewell Chin’ono for organizing a protest on July 31. Mutsvangwa reportedly described America as “evil and doom-mongers” and asserted, “Chin’ono and Ngarivhume belong to that camp of evil wishers.”

“The role of foreign powers in this plot to instigate an illegal regime change in Zimbabwe is made apparent by a set of events and statements that followed the police operation,” Mutsvangwa claimed, accusing America of seeking “cruel self-enrichment from our resources.”

Mnangagwa’s cronies have presented no evidence linking Ngarivhume and Chin’ono to the U.S. government. Police arrested both on July 20 on charges of organizing a protest against corruption and have kept them imprisoned without bail for allegedly presenting an imminent risk of expressing disagreement with the government. Ngarivhume had revealed prior to his arrest that he was receiving death threats from Mnangagwa supporters.

Chin’ono, a nationally known journalist, has been for months advocating against the Mnangagwa regime with particular emphasis on its failure to organize a competent response to the coronavirus pandemic. He revealed that Zimbabwean health workers were using bedsheets at PPE, declaring the country a “failed state” on Twitter. Chin’ono was attempting to livestream the police arriving to his home when he was arrested.

In the few moments between being denied bail at a court hearing and being returned to prison, Chin’ono managed to address the public, reportedly stating, “the struggle against corruption should continue. People should not stop. They should carry own [sic] with it.”

Twitter suspended Chin’ono’s account shortly after his arrest, presumably in response to a request from the Mnangagwa government.

The U.S. government offered Zimbabwe $470,000 for help in expanding coronavirus testing capabilities and to “implement a public-health emergency plan for points of entry,” according to the U.S. State Department. A currently available federal government grant offers up to $24,000 for proposals to help Zimbabwe ”

“President Lungu called [Xi] for debt relief and cancellation in light of reduced revenue due to the negative impact of the [Chinese coronavirus] pandemic, as well as competing needs for the country, to secure adequate resources to fight the pandemic and to stimulate the economy,” Lungu’s spokesman, Isaac Chipampe, said on Friday.

Despite Lungu’s personal plea for debt relief, “there was no commitment from Beijing to consider the request,” the Zambian president’s office said in a statement.

“Officials in Beijing have not spoken directly on the Zambian case, except confirming that Zambia and [its capital] Lusaka will continue to cooperate under the Belt and Road Initiative [BRI],” the Daily Nation wrote.

Zambia is one of many African nations heavily indebted to China through its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), which the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) uses to establish infrastructure-building projects in developing nations funded by predatory loans. The BRI projects serve Beijing by increasing foreign dependence on China and spreading CCP influence across the globe. The initiative’s success – in terms of Beijing’s interests – might be most evident in Africa, where China has become the impoverished continent’s single largest creditor.

Of Zambia’s “more than $10 billion external debt, Lusaka … owes China some $6.4 billion mostly in infrastructure development financed by Chinese lenders,” according to the report.

Zambia is running into “dire straits” on debt repayment, according to a recent analysis by African business risk consultancy firm EXX Africa.

“Last year, Lusaka failed to repay a loan to the Africa Development Bank on time as well as loan repayments to China. Earlier this year, China’s National Complete Engineering Corporation halted work on the $500 million Kafulafuta Dam in the Copperbelt after Lusaka delayed payments due to the Chinese firm,” EXX Africa explained.

“In February [2020], S&P ratings agency lowered its long-term sovereign credit rating on Zambia to ‘CCC’ from ‘CCC+’, warning that the country is vulnerable to non-payment of upcoming commercial obligations,” the study’s authors note. “Lusaka has since borrowed more, but defaulted on payments to an Italian bank, a Russian company, and other Chinese construction firms leading to stalling of projects,” EXX Africa added.

Zambia’s case serves as just one example of the larger African debt crisis, made worse by the ongoing coronavirus pandemic and the economic shutdowns it has caused. Africa’s total debt to China amounts to $145 billion, with over $8 billion in payments owed this year.

In mid-April, international financial institutions such as the World Bank called on wealthy nations to suspend debt payments from the world’s poorest countries, most in Africa, until the end of the year amid increased economic hardship during the pandemic.

China dismissed the call, insisting such a move was “not effective.” Instead, Beijing said it would work with African debtor nations “on the basis of equality and mutual benefit.”

“What China could do to help is bring projects funded by loans back to life and realize sustainable profits, instead of measures as simple as offering write-offs. As always, China is open to talk with debtors on the basis of equality and mutual benefit,” China’s Ministry of Commerce said in a statement. “Simply waiving debtors’ obligations as some countries or organizations have called for is not going to be effective as a solution.”

“In June, President Xi said China would cancel interest-free debt owed by ‘relevant’ African countries as part of Beijing’s move to help the continent during the Covid-19 [Chinese coronavirus] pandemic,” the Daily Nation wrote. “But most of China’s debt is concessional or issued by private entities meaning the credit is harder to forgive.”

“Observers say that while ­Beijing has, in the past, written off most interest-free loans extended to African nations, they accounted for less than five percent of Africa’s total financial debt to China, with the rest covered by concessional and commercial loans,” the South China Morning Post noted of Xi’s misleading promise.",Report: Xi Jinping Refused to Cancel Chinese Portion of Zambia’s $10 Billion Debt,fake

The study revealed a “huge discrepancy” in the number of coronavirus-related deaths and the number of “excess deaths” from natural causes reported during the coronavirus pandemic.

Released on Wednesday, the SAMRC report said that South Africa recorded “17,000 excess deaths from May 6 to July 14, while 6,000 coronavirus-related deaths were reported.”

“[T]he excess deaths could be due to other diseases such as tuberculosis or HIV going undertreated as resources were pooled together to fight the coronavirus,” SAMRC President Glenda Gray said.

“The numbers have shown a relentless increase — by the second week of July, there were 59 percent more deaths from natural causes than would have been expected [compared to data from the last two years],” the SAMRC report asserted.

On Friday, South Africa reported a total of 421,996 infections and 6,343 deaths from the Chinese coronavirus. The country now has the fifth-highest number of cases in the world. South Africa’s coronavirus cases account for more than half of the total reported cases for the African continent, currently estimated at 769,000.

Health experts believe the true number of coronavirus cases in South Africa and across the African continent remain much higher than officially reported due to insufficient testing and a lack of transparency by most African nations’ governments. So far, Africa has administered just 7.2 million coronavirus tests, a relatively low number for the continent’s total population of 1.3 billion people.","17,000 South Africans Die from Lack of Treatment During Lockdown",fake

According to Director-General of Health Services Dr. Henry Mwebesa, the victim was a 34-year-old woman support worker at a health facility in the eastern border district of Namisindwa, who died six days after experiencing symptoms.

“The deceased was initially admitted to Wasungui HC II on Wednesday, 15th July 2020 and treated for severe pneumonia,” said Mwebesa. “However, on Monday, 20th July 2020, she was transferred to Joy Hospice health facility, in Mbale District, where she was isolated in the female ward. The victim presented all symptoms including a fever, dry cough, and difficulty in breathing.”

“While in isolation, the patient’s condition deteriorated with difficulty in breathing, cough, chills, and headache,” he continued. “Unfortunately, she passed on Tuesday 21st July 2020 at 2:00 am. She was buried on 23rd July 2020 as per Safe Dignified Burial procedures.”

The woman was confirmed as positive for the coronavirus through tests at four separate laboratories including the Mobile Lab in Tororo, the Makerere University Laboratory, and the Central Public Health Lab at Butabika.

The ministry confirmed that those who came in contact with her, mostly her family members, have been located and placed into quarantine. Health authorities are yet to locate the source of the infection and are still struggling to do so.

“As of now we don’t know where she got infected from and we are trying to urgently identify the source,” admitted Mwesba.

Like many countries in Africa, Uganda has recorded just over 1,000 coronavirus cases, despite having a population of nearly 43 million people. As of Friday, authorities had reported 1,089 cases and 975 recoveries and joins Botswana and Burundi as countries reporting just one death. However, such figures should be treated with skepticism given the widespread lack of testing and the country’s poor healthcare system.

The greater threat to life in Uganda has largely come from the police or private militias enforcing lockdown measures. The BBC reported on Wednesday that at least 12 people have been killed by security forces since the country entered quarantine in March.

“I myself — don’t tell anybody I told you this. Especially don’t tell Joe Biden. I don’t think that there should be any debates,” the speaker bluntly stated, fueling the concerns of those who suspect Biden will cave to outside pressure and skip the presidential debates:

“I do not think that the president of the United States has comported himself in a way that has any association with truth, evidence data, and facts,” she said. “I wouldn’t legitimize a conversation with him nor a debate in terms of the presidency of the United States.”

While she acknowledged that the Biden campaign “thinks in a different way” about the subject, she drilled her point, criticizing Trump’s conduct in the 2016 debates with failed challenger Hillary Clinton.

“But I just thought what he did in 2016 was disgraceful— stalking Hillary Clinton like that,” she said, expressing disappointment in the press for refusing to tell Trump, “Go back to your station. You’re not here. You don’t own this stage. You have your own podium. She has hers.”

She told reporters she believes Trump will “act in a way that is beneath the dignity of the presidency” because he “does that every day.”

“But I think he will also belittle what the debates are supposed to be about,” she continued while accusing him of attempting to undermine the election.

“I don’t think that he [Joe Biden] should dignify that conversation with Donald Trump,” she added, suggesting separate events with conversations between the candidates and the American people.

“Let that be a conversation with the American people, not an exercise in skullduggery,” she added.

Pelosi’s call follows mounting pressure from pundits and media allies, urging Biden to forgo the traditional presidential debates. The pressure has put critics, who believe Biden could agree and opt out of the debates, on high alert.

However, his campaign has previously dismissed the concerns as an “imaginary controversy.”

“The debate commission has invited both candidates to participate in three debates. Joe Biden has accepted,” Biden spokesperson TJ Ducklo told CNN’s Oliver Darcy at the beginning of the month.

Trump’s campaign has since sought assurances from the Commission on Presidential Debates that Biden will debate the president in person.

An August 6 letter penned by Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani read in part:

We must insist on a commitment that the two candidates will definitely appear on stage, in person – whether in a television studio without an audience or elsewhere – and not through separate, online transmissions where Mr. Biden could rely on notes, teleprompter, or handlers. While we do understand that Mr. Biden has been sequestered in his basement in Wilmington, Delaware, for some time, President Trump still believes that the American people deserve to see the candidates for president side by side at some point.

Three presidential debates are currently scheduled for Tuesday, September 29; Thursday, October 15; and Thursday, October 22.

Biden said, “The problem we have right now is we’re in Donald Trump’s America. You know, to quote Kellyanne Conway, she said, and I’m paraphrasing today, they’re looking for more violence and more destruction because it helps them politically. He views this as a political benefit for him, he’s rooting for more violence, not less, and he’s clear about that. What’s he doing? He’s pouring gasoline on the fire. This happens to be Donald Trump’s America. In Donald Trump’s America COVID is out of control, he’s not prepared for it, he hasn’t responded to it, and he continues to do nothing to deal with it. We have 15 million people out of work. It just is amazing how, if you noticed, they didn’t speak about COVID, and they didn’t speak about any of the reasons why we’re doing what’s happening in Kenosha is happening.”

He added, “I condemn violence in any form, whether it’s looting or whatever it is. And by the way, when I spoke to the family, the mom was really incredibly straightforward, she said, this is not who we are as a family, this is not who my son is, we condemn the violence. So who is rooting for the violence here? And then you have, apparently, I don’t have enough detail to make a final judgment, it looks like some militia folks were there, a young man who shot two people. Where’s the condemnation coming from that? So look, if you want to talk about safety, the biggest safety issue is all the people dying from COVID. Over a thousand yesterday again. It’s a thousand people a day. We’re worse on than any other country in the world right now.”

Mitchell said, “Let me ask you, you just said that you believe that the president is rooting for the violence. Do you think the president of the United States is rooting for the violence because he thinks it helps him politically?”

Biden said, “I think he views it as a political benefit. I had a quote here from Kellyanne Conway, she said, ‘The more chaos and anarchy and vandalism and violence reigns, it’s better for us. It’s a very clear choice it presents for us.’ When has a president or a spokesperson for a president ever said something like that, ever? I mean, look, this is the same guy, when people came out of Charlottesville, and a young woman gets killed, they’re spewing hate, their veins bulging, carrying swastikas, he says they’re very fine people on both sides. He just keeps pouring fuel on the fire. He’s encouraging this. He’s not diminishing it at all. This is his America now. If we want to end this, we’ve got to end his tenure as president.”

Reports surfaced early Friday local U.S. time that Abe would resign due to unspecified health problems.

“Sources close to the Japanese Prime Minister say he plans to step down to deal with a health problem,” NHK wrote.

Abe, 65, later held a press conference where he explained his decision, saying he was “no longer in a condition to confidently respond to the mandate given him by the public.”

“I began experiencing physical problems from mid-July, and I was in a situation of wearing down my physical condition,” Abe said.

Speculation over the prime minister’s health has run rampant for the past two weeks because of repeated hospital stays.

“[H]e underwent an examination at Tokyo’s Keio University Hospital on August 14 and then returned for a followup exam on Monday [August 24],” the Japan Times reported.

In 2007, Abe was forced to step down as prime minister after serving only one year due to complications from inflammatory bowel disease. Abe returned to the post in 2012; he has served as prime minister for nearly eight years since then, making him Japan’s longest-serving leader.

Abe’s term as president of Japan’s main ruling Liberal Democratic Party “would have run out in September next year,” according to NHK.

Abe is the longest-serving prime minister in the history of modern Japan. He will remain prime minister until his party chooses a new leader.

The passengers were charged with illegally crossing the border and detained in China’s Guangdong province.

The speedboat passengers were described as young activists, several of them out on bail after they were arrested for taking part in Hong Kong protests. One of them has been tentatively identified as Andy Li, charged with “colluding with foreign forces” under the national security law China imposed on Hong Kong in June. Chinese state media has labeled him as a “secessionist.”

One of the other passengers was reportedly accused of involvement in a plot to detonate explosives at a school.

Reuters noted it has been rare until now for Chinese authorities to arrest people for illegal leaving Hong Kong. The Hong Kong police chief said he has not been officially notified of the arrest.

The Wall Street Journal anticipated the incident is “likely to fuel tensions between China and Taiwan,” since the Taiwanese government supports the Hong Kong protest movement and has offered refuge to Hong Kongers, although her government wants asylum-seekers to immigrate legally. President Tsai Ing-wen’s outspoken support for the people of Hong Kong helped her win the most resounding reelection victory in three decades.

The syndicate in question — the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) explained in an alert issued alongside the FBI, Treasury, and U.S. Cyber Command — has “attempted to steal nearly $2 billion since at least 2015, according to public estimates,” the alert stated. Identifying the group as the “BeagleBoyz,” it noted that the hackers appear to install malware into global banking computer systems that allow them to access money out of ATMs.

The $2 billion estimate may mean that North Korea is generating far more money from cyber-crime in general, as the “BeagleBoyz” is believed to be a subsidiary of a much larger umbrella network of hackers. A year ago, the United Nations reportedly estimated that all North Korean cyber criminals had stolen at least $2 billion cumulatively, suggesting an escalation of activities in the past year.

“Fraudulent ATM cash outs have affected upwards of 30 countries in a single incident. The conspirators have withdrawn cash from ATM machines operated by various unwitting banks in multiple countries, including in the United States,” the agencies asserted, noting that some smaller banks have endured the total destruction of “critical computer systems” at the hands of the hackers.

“The BeagleBoyz selectively exploit victim computer systems after initially compromising a computer connected to a financial institution’s corporate network,” the U.S. agencies explained. “After gaining initial access to a financial institution’s corporate network, the BeagleBoyz are selective in which victim systems they further exploit. The BeagleBoyz use a variety of techniques to run their code on local and remote victim systems.”

“Since February 2020, North Korea has resumed targeting banks in multiple countries to initiate fraudulent international money transfers and ATM cash outs. The recent resurgence follows a lull in bank targeting since late 2019,” the security alert read. The agencies noted that the theft, in addition to its overt status as a crime, may violate United Nations sanction on North Korea over its illegal nuclear program, as the loot may be funding illegal military projects orchestrated from Pyongyang. The theft represents “substantial revenue for North Korea,’ the agencies claimed.

The “BeagleBoyz,” the alert added, were one of a sprawling network of such groups controlled by North Korean intelligence.

The U.S. government identified itself among the nations affected by the mass thefts. Also on the list are countries across the entire planet, including but not limited to Taiwan, Turkey, Pakistan, Argentina, Ghana, and India.

The agencies concluded that banks should give defense against North Korean hackers the “highest priority.”

“We know that North Korea uses cyber enabled tactics and techniques to steal currency, which it would otherwise be denied under international sanctions,” Brig. Gen. Joe Hartman, Cyber National Mission Force Commander, said in the official press release on the alert. “The Cyber National Mission Force is laser-focused on the away game — we understand what our adversaries are doing, and we share this information with our partners to take action against them.”

The South Korean news agency Yonhap noted on Thursday that American officials have repeatedly warned of illicit North Korean cyber-activity and estimated that the regime employs up to 6,000 individual hackers for its crimes. Officials do not believe all such hackers are based within North Korea.

U.S. and global cybersecurity authorities have for years tracked increased North Korean hacking activity by groups affiliated with the communist regime. The alert on Wednesday suggested that the line that divides “BeagleBoyz” from other hacking groups is blurred: “The BeagleBoyz overlap to varying degrees with groups tracked by the cybersecurity industry as: APT38 (FireEye), Bluenoroff (Kaspersky), Lazarus Group (ESTSecurity), and Stardust Chollima (CrowdStrike).”

Lazarus is among the most famous North Korean hacking collectives, generating significant publicity for a large cyber attack on Sony’s computer network in 2014 believed to be in retaliation for Sony’s movie studio releasing The Interview, a comedy mocking dictator Kim Jong-un. In 2017, a Google security researcher found evidence that Lazarus may have been involved in the “WannaCry” ransomware attack, which affected thousands of computers around the world. Unlike the ATM schemes, which use malware that simply secretly filter money to the hackers, “WannaCry” locked all the data on the affected computers and demanded their owners send money in exchange for their computers no longer being held hostage.

Also in 2017, the last year that Kim Jong-un approved a nuclear weapon test, the security firm FireEye warned that North Korean hackers appeared to be attempting to break into delicate computer systems controlling the U.S. power grid for “early-stage reconnaissance.” A cyber attack on a power grid could cause significant civilian unrest and damage similar to that of a natural disaster. FireEye noted that the hacking activities did not appear to be attempting any “imminent” attack, only to collect information that may one day be used for an attack.

The president said his doctors advised him to stop drinking alcohol to prevent his ailment, Barrett’s esophagus, from worsening. Barrett’s esophagus is a complication of gastroesophageal reflux disease in which the stomach regurgitates its contents into the esophagus, causing it to erode. In some cases, the condition can develop into esophageal cancer, according to Johns Hopkins University.

Duterte has “previously admitted suffering from Barrett’s esophagus due to his alcohol intake,” according to the Manila Bulletin (MB). He spoke about the health condition again on Monday during his speech alongside several Philippine Cabinet members in Davao City. The 75-year-old president discussed the commitment of older Cabinet members in tackling corruption, as translated to English from Filipino by the MB.

“We have been in government for a long time. We will retire soon so why would we waste it? We have a few years left, we no longer have an appetite to eat,” Duterte said. “You have money but you can’t eat because the doctors said you must not eat fat because you will die.”

Seeming to repeat his own doctor’s orders, the president continued, “Duterte, do not drink because your Barrett is nearing stage one cancer, so I stopped.”

“For us, we would leave behind the job we did. Because when we face God and he will ask you, ‘Rodrigo, what did you do?’ I’ll say ‘I did everything’,” he added.

The president’s spokesman, Harry Roque, attempted to backtrack Duterte’s claims of cancer on Wednesday.

“People are putting too much meaning on his statement. I think that advice [to reduce alcohol consumption due to his Barrett’s esophagus] was given to him a long time ago when the president was still drinking. He has since stopped drinking and as far as I know since he became president he has not resumed drinking,” Roque told CNN Philippines.

“So you’re talking of medical advice that happened many years ago, even prior to the presidency. And I think the reason why the president precisely stopped drinking was to prevent it [his case of Barrett’s esophagus] from developing into stage one cancer. That is the context of what the president said,” Roque added.

“I guess rephrasing what the president said, he almost had cancer if he did not stop drinking. But he has since stopped drinking,” the spokesman explained. “He doesn’t drink, he doesn’t smoke, he has no vices as president because he wants to be in good and healthy condition … So far he is okay. As far as I know, there is no cancer. As I said, if there is cancer, he will be reporting it to the people.”

In October 2018, Duterte said in a public address that he was awaiting the results of a cancer screening.

“I don’t know where I’m now physically, but I have to wait for that,” the president stated in a nationally televised speech. “But, I will tell you if it’s cancer, it’s cancer. If it’s third stage, no more treatment. I will not prolong the agony in this office or anywhere,” he added.

“His comments sparked immediate concern and speculation, but days later he said the tests had come back negative,” the Guardian reported

In years past, Duterte has also said he suffers from a litany of other ailments, including Buerger’s disease, an illness that causes inflammation in the limbs’ veins and arteries. Buerger’s is usually caused by smoking.

Duterte regularly cites his ill health as a reason for skipping events, both domestically and during official summits abroad. In 2017, he disappeared for a week from public view in the Philippines, “fuelling speculation he was ill. The government insisted then the speculation was baseless,” Reuters noted.

The serious and organised crime focused law enforcement agency, roughly equivalent to America’s Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), got ringleader Ameran Zeb Khan and seven other men in the dock for sentencing in July 2017 after a years-long investigation kicked off by UK Border Force discovering a 165 kilos (over 360 pounds) of uncut heroin concealed in a shipment of industrial lathes.

The NCA boasts in an official statement that the Birmingham-based criminals “were imprisoned for a total of 139 years and four months” — although, as is often the case with reports on British sentences, this is misleading, as adding up multiple sentences across multiple people, some of which individuals may be intended to serve concurrently, tells the public little about how long anyone will actually serve in custody, particularly as it is standard for convicts in Britain to be automatically released on licence halfway or two-thirds of the way through their terms.

Possibly more effective are the civil recovery investigations the NCA has been conducting over almost a decade into “dozens of individuals who were suspected of financial links to [the] drug dealers in East Birmingham”, leading to the seizure of the dozens of mostly private residential properties.

The NCA found that the drug dealers “would use family members and wider associates to hold properties on their behalf… to conceal and launder the proceeds of their unlawful conduct”, with income being generated from properties rented out in Birmingham, Bangor in Northern Ireland, and a gym named Rampage Fitness.

The NCA now reports that it has sold off all but one of the properties, with the proceeds being “paid into the public purse” in a move its Head of Asset Denial, Andy Lewis, described as “display[ing] the power of civil investigations working in tandem with criminal ones to take high harm organised crime groups down.”

One of the missiles, a DF-26B, was launched from China’s northwestern province of Qinghai, located northeast of Tibet. The “aircraft-carrier killer” missile, a DF-21D, launched from eastern China’s coastal Zhejiang province, located north of Taiwan. Both missiles were fired into an area of the South China Sea between Hainan province and Vietnam’s Paracel Islands, according to the source. Hainan is China’s southernmost island province located east of Vietnam.

The DF-21D “can target aircraft carriers and other warships underway at sea at a range of up to 1,500 kilometers [932 miles],” Reuters reported, citing Chinese and Western military analysts. The DF-26 missile is “dual-capable, which means it can deliver both nuclear and conventional warheads and is thought to have a range of approximately 4,000 kilometers (2,490 miles),” according to the Federation of American Scientists.

“Under the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, a Cold War-era agreement aimed at reducing the threat of nuclear conflict, the United States and Russia are banned from deploying this class of missiles [land-based, intermediate-range ballistic and cruise missiles, including the DF-26 and DF-21D], with a range between 500 and 5,500 kilometers (3,418 miles).

The Financial Times reports that the CEO of the Chinese-owned video-sharing app TikTok, Kevin Mayer, notified employees at TikTok and its parent company ByteDance that he plans to leave his position at the Chinese company. The current general manager of TikTok, Vanessa Pappas, will become interim head of TikTok.

Mayer, a former Disney executive, made the decision to leave shortly after President Trump ordered a ban on the app unless ByteDance sold its U.S. assets to an American company within 90 days. American tech giants Microsoft and Oracle have both expressed interest in purchasing TikTok’s U.S. business. Mayer had only left Disney for TikTok in May of this year.

Mayer announced his departure in a letter to employees stating:

In recent weeks, as the political environment has sharply changed, I have done significant reflection on what the corporate structural changes will require, and what it means for the global role I signed up for. Against this backdrop, and as we expect to reach a resolution very soon, it is with a heavy heart that I wanted to let you all know that I have decided to leave the company. I understand that the role that I signed up for — including running TikTok globally — will look very different as a result of the US administration’s action to push for a sell off of the US business.

The Financial Times reports that Mayer did not anticipate the extent to which TikTok’s operations in the U.S. would become a political matter. One person with knowledge of the situation commented: “He didn’t sign up for this. He has put himself in a sensitive political zone. He will have to align himself with both his Chinese masters and public scrutiny in the US.”

ByteDance CEO Zhang Yiming said in a letter to employees that he understood Mayer’s decision to leave given the political challenge that TikTok is facing. In the letter, Yiming stated: “Kevin spoke to me, and I fully understand that the resulting outcome that we land upon due to the political circumstances we are operating within could have significant impact on his job in any scenario, but particularly given his global role while he’s based in the US.”

Chen spent years advocating for the rights of women in his rural Chinese community who had suffered forced abortions as a result of the “one-child policy,” which required Communist Party officials to kill unauthorized children. For his efforts, the Party imprisoned Chen for seven years. He escaped in 2012, fleeing to the U.S. embassy in Beijing and ultimately to the United States.

During his speech on Wednesday, Chen applauded Trump for confronting the Party, calling China under communism an “enemy of humanity” and urging Americans to vote for Trump “for the sake of the world.” Chen was one of several survivors of communist regimes around the world given a platform at the RNC to tell their stories and argue that Trump’s foreign policy has successfully addressed the countries’ repression.

“Why did the Republican Party invite Chen? Will Chen’s groundless smear have any substantial effect on Trump’s campaign?” the Global Times, often China’s most belligerent English-language outlet, asked on Thursday. The newspaper then quoted two political “experts,” Party-approved Marxist professors, to disparage Chen’s appearance at the event.

“The [Republican] party could not find any more decent people to give a speech, nor could it find any new topic. Chen has been wandering in the US for almost 10 years since he arrived in the country in 2012,” an “expert” identified as Fudan University professor Shen Yi, is quoted as saying. “He has no other value for the Republican Party except to blacken China. Such slander will not have any substantial impacts on China.”

“The convention demonstrates that under the strong influence of the Trump administration, the whole Republican Party is turning from a party of elites into a street gang. The convention looks like a large party of third-tier talk show actors,” Shen claimed. He did not elaborate on what about Chen projected a “street gang” atmosphere at the event.

Shen also apparently attempted to use Chen’s blindness to insult the United States, saying, “Now, the US is immersed in blindness as an anti-intellectual and hysterical perspective with which to comprehend China.”

The other “expert” the Global Times appeals to, another Fudan University scholar, did not attack Chen personally as severely as Shen. Instead, the “expert,” Xin Qiang, makes the case that Republicans carefully noting that the Chinese Communist Party – not the Chinese people – is the enemy is a failed tactic because the ethnic Han Chinese people are inseparable from communism.

“According to historical traditions and customs, Chinese people tend to believe that government, country and the people are integrated. They cannot be separated. China is led by the CPC. An assault on any of these three truly hurts the feelings of the Chinese people,” Xin claimed, calling Chen’s speech “ridiculous to the Chinese people.”

The Chinese Communist Party regularly makes the claim that to be born Chinese is to be communist, and only “traitors” and undesirables within the Chinese ranks do not support the Party.

“Advocating for the separation of the CPC from the Chinese people for so-called targeted attacks is the fantasy and delusion of a few U.S. elites. It is as hypocritical and arrogant as attacking a man’s heart and nervous system yet claiming to be beneficial to his whole body,” the Global Times asserted in a column published in July. “Opposing all CPC members is undoubtedly opposing all Chinese people.”

While not addressing Chen by name, the state newswire service Xinhua also attacked the RNC as a hotbed of anti-Chinese discrimination in a column on Thursday.

“One of the most bizarre characteristics of America’s 2020 presidential election is that political attacks on China have gone well beyond common sense,” Xinhua claimed. “The vicious rhetoric against Beijing has hit one fresh low after another this week at the ongoing Republican National Convention.”

“Those China hardliners in fact slapped themselves in their own faces when they were brazen enough to boast that the United States is not a racist country while constantly making ill-founded accusations against China that suggest otherwise,” Xinhua asserted. “Such apparent cognitive dissonance and their wicked political motivation to scapegoat China are too obvious to miss.”

Xinhua, like the Global Times, did not offer evidence to refute any of Chen’s statements in his speech.

“The CCP is an enemy of humanity. It is terrorizing its own people and it is threatening the well-being of the world,” Chen told the RNC audience. “In China, expressing beliefs or ideas not approved by the CCP – religion, democracy, human rights – can lead to prison. The nation lives under mass surveillance and censorship.”

“The U.S. must use its values of freedom, democracy, and the rule of law, to gather a coalition of other democracies to stop CCP’s aggression. President Trump has led on this and we need the other countries to join him in this fight. A fight for our future,” Chen urged. “We need to support, vote, and fight for President Trump – for the sake of the world.”

Xi’s speech comes amid deteriorating economic relations between the U.S. and China over trade and technology disputes.

“Beijing used to have cozy relationships with Wall Street firms and American businesses with large operations in China, but that goodwill has thinned considerably in recent years. Among U.S. states, China has traditionally had close economic ties with the west coast – California, Oregon, and Washington – while its purchases of American agriculture products as part of the phase one trade deal have also boosted interactions with Midwest farm states,” the South China Morning Post (SCMP) wrote on Tuesday. In January, U.S. President Donald Trump signed a “phase one” trade deal with China pausing “a damaging trade war — involving retaliatory tariffs being slapped on billions of dollars worth of goods — between the world’s top two economies that started in 2018,” according to CNBC. A key feature of the phase one trade deal was China’s commitment to buy at least $200 billion more from America over two years, compared to 2017 purchases. However, recent data compiled by the Peterson Institute for International Economics shows that “[i]n the first half of 2020, China bought less than a quarter of the targeted full-year amount of U.S. goods agreed under the deal.” Trade representatives from the U.S. and China reviewed the progress of their phase one trade deal in a conference call on Tuesday. U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin spoke with Chinese Vice-Premier Liu He. The representatives said that the U.S. and China had made some progress in implementing the deal since its signing in January. The parties agreed to “create conditions and atmosphere” to ensure its future success.

The CCP has increasingly pressured local U.S. governments to promote Beijing’s interests in recent years.

On February 8, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo warned of the troubling phenomenon at a national governors association meeting:

Let me read you an excerpt of a letter from a Chinese diplomat. It was China’s Consul General in New York sent a letter last month to the speaker of one of your state legislatures. Here’s what the letter said in part. It said, quote, “As we all know, Taiwan is part of China … avoid engaging in any official contact with Taiwan, including sending congratulatory messages to the electeds, introducing bills and proclamations for the election, sending officials and representatives to attend the inauguration ceremony, and inviting officials in Taiwan to visit the United States.” End of quote from the letter. Think about that. You had a diplomat from China assigned here to the United States, a representative of the Chinese Communist Party in New York City, sending an official letter urging that an American elected official shouldn’t exercise his right to freedom of speech.

On February 22, just two weeks after Pompeo warned of the CCP’s infiltration of local government bodies, a New York City public library agreed to remove an exhibit on Chinese-occupied Tibet after the local Tibetan community objected to the content as CCP propaganda.

“[T]he Chinese Consulate and its affiliate made the decision to discontinue the exhibit, which will be removed,” the Queens Library said in a statement following protests by local Tibetans who said the exhibit’s content attempted to whitewash the CCP’s human rights abuses in Tibet.

In April 2019, California sent its democrat Lieutenant Governor Eleni Kounalakis to Beijing to attend the CCP’s Belt and Road (BRI) Forum. The CCP uses the infrastructure-building BRI to gain a foothold in developing nations, who become indebted to Bejing through predatory loans used to fund the projects.

While attending the CCP summit, Kounalakis heaped praise on the BRI as a means for China – the world’s largest emitter of carbon dioxide – to “drive positive action for this global threat,” referring to global warming.

The Lt. Governor said California had signed “several memorandums of understanding” with Beijing and “built up a partnership based on the shared principle of fighting climate change.”

In September 2018, “China and California held a three-day summit in San Francisco to discuss the issue [of climate change] with the endorsement of Chinese President Xi Jinping, who sent a personal message of support to the governor at the time, Jerry Brown,” the South China Morning Post reported.

According to DPP lawmaker Wang Ting-yu, “reliable sources” within Japan’s national security officials claim that the post office account connected to the delivery of the mysterious packages, the majority of which contained seeds, had ties to Chen.

On August 13th, the Taipei District Prosecutors’ Office indicted Chen and two other former legislative assistants on charges of violating the National Security Act by allegedly collecting classified materials and meeting minutes from the Legislative Yuan, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Mainland Affairs Council, and passing on details of government personnel to Chinese intelligence officials.

Chen is currently free on a NT$100,000 ($3,500) bail but cannot leave the country. Politicians including DPP lawmaker Chao Tien-lin argued that if officials can prove a connection between Chen and his alleged handler, working under the alias “Huang Guanlong,” his bail should be immediately rescinded.

The calls for an investigation come more than a month after thousands of unsolicited packages carrying seeds believed to be from China arrived in the mailboxes of Americans and others abroad, leading to a warning from U.S. agricultural officials not to plant them.

Some of these packages — falsely labeled as jewelry, toys, or electronic devices — had Chinese writing on them but are believed to have been shipped through Taiwan in an attempt to drive a wedge between Taipei and its western allies.

Federal officials from the Department of Agriculture (USDA) pledged to work with the Department of Homeland Security and local officials to prevent any more illegal seeds from entering the country.

“[We are] aware that people across the country have received unsolicited packages of seed from China in recent days,” the USDA said in a statement. “At this time, we don’t have any evidence indicating this is something other than a ‘brushing scam’ where people receive unsolicited items from a seller who then posts false customer reviews to boost sales.”

Residents of Tampa Bay in Florida also reported receiving unsolicited masks this month in what some believed to be a “brushing” scheme to boost sales. This technique involves third-party sellers creating fake orders in order to post positive reviews about themselves on online market places such as Amazon and eBay.

“The companies, usually foreign, third-party sellers that are sending the items are simply using your address that they discovered online,” notes the Better Business Bureau. “Their intention is to make it appear as though you wrote a glowing online review of their merchandise, and that you are a verified buyer of that merchandise.”

“They then post a fake, positive review to improve their products’ ratings, which means more sales for them,” its advice adds. “The payoff is highly profitable from their perspective.”",Taiwanese Lawmakers Trace Chinese 'Mystery Seeds' to Alleged Spy,fake

Chen, a blind self-taught legal scholar from a rural community, spent those years in both prison and house arrest after police detained him for his advocacy against forced abortions, a common policy under China’s “one-child” rule that prevented families from birthing siblings. Currently, due to a precipitous decline in population, China has expanded that policy to two children but is still believed to force women to kill illegal unborn children.

In his address Wednesday, Chen expressed gratitude to America for granting him and his family a chance to build a life free of authoritarianism.

“Standing up to tyranny is not easy. I know. When I spoke out against China’s ‘one-child’ policy and other injustices, I was persecuted, beaten, sent to prison and put under house arrest by the Chinese Communist Party,” Chen noted. “In April 2012, I escaped and was given shelter in the American embassy in Beijing. I am forever grateful to the American people for welcoming me and my family to the United States where we are now free.”

“The CCP is an enemy of humanity. It is terrorizing its own people and it is threatening the well-being of the world,” Chen affirmed. “In China, expressing beliefs or ideas not approved by the CCP – religion, democracy, human rights – can lead to prison. The nation lives under mass surveillance and censorship.”

Investigations by monitor groups, human rights organizations, and media outlets have confirmed the existence of over 1,000 concentration camps in western Xinjiang province housing between 1 and 3 million people belonging to the Uyghur ethnic minority, as well as other Muslim ethnic minorities. Those who have survived the camps say they are forced to pledge fealty to the Communist Party, worship dictator Xi Jinping, engage in slave labor, witness and endure torture and rape, and suffer forced sterilizations and abortions.

China refers to the camps as “vocational training centers.” Xinjiang residents not in camps live under constant surveillance, including CCP agents living in their homes as spies.

Chen concluded stating that he believed President Donald Trump “has shown the courage to wage” the fight against Beijing.

“The U.S. must use its values of freedom, democracy, and the rule of law, to gather a coalition of other democracies to stop CCP’s aggression. President Trump has led on this and we need the other countries to join him in this fight. A fight for our future,” Chen said. “We need to support, vote, and fight for President Trump – for the sake of the world.”

Chen is free today after escaping house arrest and fleeing to the American embassy in Beijing in 2012. Once there – arriving during a visit by then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to the capital – Chen later said the Obama administration pressured him into going to a Chinese Communist Party hospital to treat his injuries and denied him access to the internet.

“The embassy kept lobbying me to leave and promised to have people stay with me at the hospital, but this afternoon, as soon as I checked into the hospital room, I noticed they were all gone,” Chen said in 2012, after his escape from house arrest but before leaving China, saying he felt lied to. He similarly condemned the Obama administration in his memoir, The Barefoot Lawyer, published shortly after Clinton applauded herself for saving Chen in her own book, Hard Choices.

“For vitamins and antibiotics, more than 90 percent of their raw materials are produced in China. The U.S. will definitely not be able to produce them in the short term. Of course, we will not take the lead in doing this, but if the U.S. dares to play dirty, we have these countermeasures,” Li said in an interview with “local media” cited by the SCMP.

The United States imposed sanctions on China’s semiconductor supply in May and tightened them in August, preventing Chinese telecom giant Huawei from obtaining the advanced processors it needs for its line of smartphones. Some analysts believe Huawei’s smartphone business will not recover from the loss of chips, although other Chinese companies would take much of its market share.

Li said that if the U.S. cuts off China’s semiconductor supply even further, it would be a “nuclear option” that would justify China retaliating by choking off the supply of medicine and medical components. He also thought the U.S. might impose restrictions that would make it difficult for China to access the international banking system, a prospective action he denounced as “economic terrorism.”

“Disrupting the Chinese economy is equivalent to picking a fight with the Chinese people on the food issue. China can then pick a fight with the US on the supply of medicines, right?” said Li.

“We are open to negotiations, but if you are unreasonable, we will fight you to the end at any cost,” he added.

The actual degree of American dependence on China for pharmaceuticals and drug components is a matter of some debate. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not been able to pinpoint exactly how many Chinese companies are involved in the U.S. supply chain, or how well the American pharmaceutical industry would be able to cope if all the Chinese suppliers went offline.

One of the lingering questions is how rapidly the industry could find other suppliers or spin up domestic production, using advanced technology and innovative manufacturing techniques. The Chinese have been threatening to manipulate the U.S. drug supply ever since the trade war went badly for them in 2019, and everyone from pharma executives to the Pentagon has been aware of the strategic vulnerability that was created by allowing China to monopolize the supply chain.

China, for its part, is doing what it can to reduce its dependency on imported semiconductors, including a spirited effort to steal the technology it needs from its major suppliers in Taiwan. China’s premier chipmaker, the government-funded Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. (SMIC), said in early August that it believes it can achieve parity with the U.S. semiconductor industry within the next generation of computer chips.",Chinese Govt Adviser Calls for Weaponizing Medical Exports Against U.S.,fake

The company removed footage of the 1989 Tiananmen Square Massacre based on outcry from Communist China. China accused Activision of “exporting ideology” and bringing “politics into videogames,” leading the company to censor the game trailer around the world.

PC Gamer reports that a recently released trailer for the video game Call of Duty: Black Ops – Cold War, the latest addition tot eh popular Call of Duty series, was taken down and censored by game publisher Activision to remove footage of the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests. The company took the action to please the Communist government of China, but also removed other sections, including an interview with a Russian defector describing the country’s attacks on American culture.

The game trailer features footage from a number of true-life events including USSR defector Yuri Bezmenov discussing a four-stage Soviet strategy to end American dominance in the world, including demoralization, destabilization, crisis, and normalization. Other clips include footage of the Vietnam war and the Tiananmen Square protests.

Earlier this week the first version fo the trailer was deleted from Activision’s YouTube channel and replaced with a new version that was about half as long as the original trailer. According to the South China Morning Post, the original video was deleted due to the footage from the Tiananmen Square protest featured in the trailer, initially, the video was replaced with a version that had those sections blacked out but ultimately the entire clip was replaced with sections cut entirely.

The original video is still available on multiple gaming-related channels such as IGN and Gamespot. When comparing the original trailer to the new version, it becomes noticeable that many sections have been cut including Bezmenov’s interview. The original trailer can be seen below:

Hong Kong’s Apple Daily alleges that the footage was first called out by Chinese internet users who accused Activision of “exporting ideology” and bringing “politics into videogames.”

Breitbart News reported in June that Chinese dissidents and human rights advocates gathered online to commemorate the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre. Breitbart News reporter Frances Martel reports:

The Victims of Communism Memorial Fund, a human rights organization dedicated to carrying the memory of those afflicted by left-wing totalitarianism, organized and broadcast the event. Given ongoing Chinese coronavirus social distancing measures, speakers “attended” the event from separate locations. The event occurred in the shadow of vandals, acting amid a nationwide wave of radical leftist violence, defacing Washington, DC’s, Victims of Communism memorial – a statue of the “Goddess of Liberty,” which Tiananmen protesters hoisted in the square before the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) rolled its tanks in. In addition to discussing the lasting legacy of the pro-democracy advocates killed on June 4, 1989, in Beijing, the speakers noted that the communist policies that led to the complete erasure of the Tiananmen Square massacre from the Chinese internet, Chinese history books, and the Chinese public memory in the country are behind the obfuscation that resulted in extended delays in alerting the world to the potential threat of the newly discovered coronavirus in Wuhan, China. “Unfortunately, the evil regime of the Chinese Communist Party [CCP] is still raging on the land of China, and it is still using brutal and cruel methods to suppress and persecute the Chinese people,” Chen Guangcheng, a Chinese human rights attorney and former political prisoner, said at the vigil. “Not only we must not forget the CCP’s June 4th massacre, but we must also record each and every crime that the CCP has done to persecute the Chinese people over the past 30 years, and be prepared to hold them accountable.” “The appeasement policy must come to an end,” he added.

Rajapaksa and his brother, Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa, swept to a resounding victory in August’s elections that result in four Rajapaksas joining the nation’s parliament in addition to the brothers. As president, Mahinda Rajapaksa, who ruled from 2005 to 2015, presided over much of Sri Lanka’s pivot to closer ties with the Chinese Communist Party. The New York Times has reported that evidence exists the Chinese corporation that built the seized port at Hambantota gave Rajapaksa millions of dollars.

Now, under his brother, the nation’s top diplomat is vowing that Sri Lanka will keep some distance from China.

“President (Gotabaya Rajapaksa) has stated that in terms of strategic security, we will follow an ‘India first’ policy. We cannot afford to be a strategic security threat to India and we don’t have to be. We need to benefit from India,” the Times of India quoted Foreign Minister Colombage as saying in a televised interview in Sri Lanka on Monday.

Colombage also reportedly described handing over the Hambantota port as a “mistake.”

In an interview with similar themes published by Sri Lanka’s Daily Mirror on Wednesday, Colombage similarly stated that Rajapaksa seeks to assuage concerns in India that Sri Lanka has moved too close diplomatically to China. The Indian government under Prime Minister Narendra Modi has moved to distance itself from China, banning mobile phone applications made in China from use in the country and seeking to attract global companies out of China with its “Make in India” initiative. India and China also experienced its deadliest military exchange in half a century in July on their mutual Himalayan border, caused by Indian troops asking People’s Liberation Army (PLA) soldiers why they were erecting tents on sovereign Indian territory.

“Sri Lanka does not want to be caught up in the power game. Sri Lanka wants to develop friendly international ties with everybody,” Colombage told the Mirror.

Addressing Hambantota specifically, Colombage explained the strategic importance of the port geographically, in the heart of a major Asian trade route.

“The Hambantota Port is located at the most strategic point in the Indian Ocean. That is the centre of the ocean. It is exactly in the centre between Singapore and Dubai, and Shanghai and Rotterdam as far as the distances are concerned,” Colombage said. “The busiest shipping lane in the world is just 12 nautical miles south off Hambantota. … We need a port there.”

The foreign minister then appeared to blame India and the former administration of Gotabaya Rajapaksa’s predecessor, Maithripala Sirisena, for China taking the port over.

“Everyone knows, we initially offered it to India. India did not undertake it for whatever the reason. May be it was because of lack of capacity. Or, they could not take that decision at that moment. Then, it went to a Chinese company,” Colombage said. “We had given the Hambantota Port on a 99-year-lease to China Merchants Port Holding Company, which India, Japan, and America considered as wrong. We actually made India jittery during the period between 2015 and 2019. But India is comfortable with President Gotabaya Rajapaksa.”

Colombage also rejected, however, bringing Sri Lanka closer to Western free states, arguing that the bests interests of Sri Lanka require closer ties to its immediate neighbors.

“We see a clear shift in the world economic order from the west to the east or Asia for that matter. Therefore, our main focus should also be on neighbourhood — South Asia, Africa, the Middle-East, ASEAN and Far East,” Colombage said. “We have maintained a non-aligned policy since independence. We also see that we have been having somewhat of a Western-oriented diplomacy. We venerate the West virtually.”

“Our foreign policy should not be tailored to what is best for another country. It should be tailored for what is best for Sri Lankans and Sri Lanka,” he concluded.

The Hambantota port is, in many ways, the crowning achievement of China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), a plan to convince developing nations to allow China to build major transportation infrastructure there that they cannot afford. China offers predatory loans that the country cannot repay and, when the nation defaults, seizes what it built. The money goes to paying Chinese companies — which vow to hire locally and create jobs, but rarely do — that then seize the property.

China seized Hambantota in 2017, receiving a 99-year lease on the property.

Sri Lanka is currently in the middle of a strict Chinese coronavirus lockdown to prevent the virus from spreading further, significantly hurting laborers who say they cannot access jobs. In mid-August, port workers in the capital, Colombo, organized a protest demanding an explanation for why Chinese workers at the Colombo port were allowed to work without interruption, but they could not find a way to generate money, banned from the work sites.

“They kept these gates closed restricting the employees while the Chinese freely roam,” Kanishka Heshan, one of the protesters, told local reporters.

All the aforementioned players were pivotal to Sri Lanka’s involvement with BRI. Wickremesinghe was prime minister in 2002 under an SLPP president, when Sri Lanka agreed to allow China to build to Port of Hambantota, which it lost to China in 2017. Mahinda Rajapaksa succeeded him in 2004.

Under Sirisena, Sri Lanka responded to the loss of Hambantota by signing more BRI contracts worth over $50 million, despite the fact that it could not pay back the original loan it took out nearly two decades prior.

The United States issued sanctions on several of Chinese companies involved in BRI projects on Wednesday, including the company that built the port of Hambantota, China Harbor Engineering Corp. China Harbor is a subsidiary of China Communications Construction Co. (CCCC), one of five receiving sanctions and part of 24 companies in total now restricted from doing business in America.

The Global Times claimed its Communist Party-approved “experts” did not believe that the RNC’s focus on the damage that Beijing has done to the global economy, both with its increasingly large stranglehold on manufacturing and its inability to contain the Chinese coronavirus, would be an effective message for swing voters. One “expert” claimed that only “die-hard” fans of President Donald Trump could tolerate even five minutes of the RNC broadcast.

The article also contrasted the support Democrat Party presidential candidate Joe Biden received from Jeff Flake, a former Republican senator and prominent supporter of the interests of the Castro regime in Cuba, with an alleged dearth of Democrats supporting Trump. The Global Times piece was published after the first night of the convention, where Georgia state Sen. Vernon Jones, a Democrat, praised Trump for his support of historically black colleges and universities (HCBUs).

“The speakers in the Republican convention tried to sell fear and hyped xenophobia to cover the Trump administration’s failed handling of the COVID-19 [Chinese coronavirus] pandemic,” the Global Times claimed. “Experts said the event can only influence uneducated and conservative extremists, but these voters are not enough to get Trump reelected.”

“Compared to the Democrats’ national convention, the Republicans on Monday hyped fear toward the Democrats, Joe Biden, and foreign countries, including China, Muslim countries, and U.S. neighbors Mexico and Canada,” the Chinese outlet claimed, quoting an alleged Chinese “expert” adding, “If you are not a die-hard fan to Trump but a neutral researcher on US politics, you can’t listen to those speakers for more than five minutes.”

The Global Times did not cite any examples of the alleged “xenophobia,” particularly in support of its bizarre claim that Republicans were attempting to stoke fear in Americans towards Canada. Multiple speakers did note that China’s dominance of global manufacturing was a threat to the world, and the broadcast featured a video in part blaming the failed, favorable-to-China leadership of the World Health Organization (W.H.O.) for the extent of the destruction caused by the Chinese coronavirus, but did not target ethnic Han Chinese people.

While the RNC’s Monday night broadcast featured speakers of a variety of ethnic backgrounds and at least one refugee, Cuban-American businessman Máximo Álvarez, Tuesday’s schedule following the publication of the Global Times attack focused directly on the issue of integrating new Americans into the national fabric. President Donald Trump personally presided over a live naturalization ceremony for five new citizens from Asia, Africa, the Middle East, and Latin America and the keynote speaker was an immigrant from a formerly communist country: First Lady Melania Trump.

“I arrived in the United States when I was 26 years old. Living and working in the land of opportunity was a dream come true but I wanted more. I wanted to be a citizen. After ten years of paperwork and patience, I studied for the test in 2006 and became an American citizen,” Trump detailed. “It is still one of the proudest moments in my life because, with hard work and determination, I was able to achieve my own American dream. As an immigrant and a very independent woman, I understand what a privilege it is to live here and enjoy the freedoms and opportunities that we have.”

Another “expert” — identified as “Diao Daming, a US politics expert and an associate professor at the Renmin University of China in Beijing,” expressed particular disgust at Kimberly Guilfoyle, the national chair of the Trump Victory Finance Committee, describing her speech Monday as “extremely radical and maniacal.”

“The same socialist policies which destroyed places like Cuba and Venezuela must not take root in our cities and our schools,” Guilfoyle warned in her speech. “Don’t let them kill future generations, because they told you and brainwash you and fed you lies that you weren’t good enough.”

A third “expert” in the article predicted that the RNC would not succeed in attracting new voters, observing without explanation, “Trump and his team are playing the game according to a desperately peculiar ‘garbage-time playbook.'”

The Chinese government has formally remained silent on the convention, though confronting China’s colonialism in developing countries and its ongoing campaign of espionage and intellectual property theft is a key theme of the event. The Foreign Ministry has yet to comment on the RNC, though it has resumed its regular attacks on Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who spoke at the convention on Tuesday. The Global Times at press time is the only English-language Chinese state outlet openly condemning the RNC. The People’s Daily, the official newspaper of the Communist Party of China, published an attack on Trump’s publication of his agenda for a second term in office, which occurred on the eve of the convention. The People’s Daily once again condemned the Trump administration for its focus on Communist Party crimes.

“By playing the China blame card, Trump is not only shifting domestic attention and attracting support, but also catering to the voices of domestic anti-China hawks and interest groups. In other words, the Republican Party has reached a high degree of consensus on Trump’s policy toward China,” the People’s Daily claimed on Wednesday. “As the virus rages on in the US, Trump will not easily give up the tactic of blaming China because this seems to be working. If Trump is re-elected, it can be expected that he will continue to use the pandemic and other factors as excuses to suppress China.”

Prashant Bhushan is a public interest lawyer who has built a reputation around challenging recent Indian governments and criticizing Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his ruling Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).

Bhushan appeared in court on Tuesday for posting two tweets which India’s supreme court ruled were a “calculated attack on the very foundation of the institution of the judiciary” and in “serious contempt of court” on August 14. The court had previously given Bhushan until August 24 to apologize for the tweets. That deadline passed on Monday, with Bhushan refusing to apologize and saying he would rather face the sentence of six months in jail, according to Voice of America (VOA).

In one tweet, Bhushan posted a photograph of Indian Chief Justice Sharad Arvind Bobde on what appears to be an expensive motorcycle, reportedly owned by the son of a local politician belonging to the ruling BJP party, which Bhushan opposes. Bobde is pictured without a sanitary mask while surrounded by people.

In the tweet, “Bhushan said it was hypocritical of the chief justice to be in a crowd without a mask when the justice had ordered the court to shut down during the coronavirus outbreak, denying Indians of their ‘fundamental right to access justice’,” VOA wrote of the post, which Twitter censored.

The court denounced the tweet as “patently false” and said it had the power to shake public confidence in the nation’s judiciary. Bhushan’s hearing has been adjourned until September 10.",India: Court Says Dissident Must Apologize for Tweets or Go to Jail,fake

The Z-8L is expected to enter service with PLA aerial assault troops “and to play a major role in multiple scenarios including amphibious assault missions,” military analysts told the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) newspaper Global Times on Tuesday.

The domestically developed Z-8L is the first helicopter of its type in the 15 ton-class in China. The helicopter “will be commissioned into the PLA’s aerial assault forces to enhance the troops’ comprehensive transport and overall combat capability,” according to the report.

“In addition to operating in a wide range of terrains including plains, valleys, and plateaus, the Z-8L can also join cross-sea amphibious assault missions when paired up with amphibious landing and assault ships,” an anonymous Chinese “military expert” told the newspaper.



According to the CCP mouthpiece, China’s PLA has in recent years attached increasing importance to “helicopters and vertical landing tactics in its amphibious landing missions. It has launched two Type 075 amphibious assault ships, also known as helicopter carriers, since 2019.”

Last week, state-run China Central Television (CCTV) reported that the PLA 71st Group Army recently conducted drills involving multiple types of helicopters in the Yellow Sea, located between China and the Korean Peninsula. The helicopters practiced deck-landing training on a semi-submersible vessel, fuel and ammunition replenishment, and emergency repair on a civilian semi-submersible ship.

“According to the training scenario, after the multi-type helicopters flied [sic] to the target island, the transport helicopter selected a site for landing with the attack helicopter on alert overhead. Then the transport helicopter carried the mocked wounded soldiers to a civilian semi-submersible vessel for a replenishment-at-sea,” China Military Online, the PLA’s official English news website, reported.

The Global Times quoted “Beijing-based naval expert” Li Jie as saying that the large decks of semi-submersible ships may serve as “temporary helicopter carriers, landing decks, and maintenance centers.”

“In a potential major mission on large islands or reefs, they can be deployed to become maritime relay platforms to extend the combat radius of helicopters,” Li explained.

The PLA’s debut of its new helicopter comes as China’s military says it will hold “three separate naval exercises and live-fire drills simultaneously this week, with one of them covering parts of the South China Sea disputed between China, Taiwan, and Vietnam,” Radio Free Asia (RFA) reported on Monday.

On Friday, the Maritime Safety Administration of Hainan — China’s southernmost island province located east of Vietnam in the South China Sea — announced that a military exercise would be held in an area near Vietnam’s Paracel Islands from August 24-29. The notice “warned outside vessels to steer five nautical miles clear of the drill area but otherwise gave no details,” according to RFA.

The Paracel Islands are a disputed island chain located southeast of Hainan and east of Vietnam in the north of the South China Sea. Beijing illegally claims the archipelago and has established a military base on the Paracels’ largest islet, Woody Island. The boundaries of the PLA exercises slated for this week include Woody Island and the waters northeast of the Paracels near Pratas Atoll, claimed by Taiwan, according to the report.

RFA said it had viewed recent satellite imagery revealing “some of China’s aircraft and warships that may have been positioned in the South China Sea ahead of time, either to participate in the exercise or to provide supplies to China’s disparate outposts.”

“Four fighter jets and multiple military transport aircraft were stationed at Woody Island, a prime staging area for China’s military operations in the South China Sea, on August 17, and one fighter jet and what appears to be a military transport aircraft remained there on August 22,” RFA reported.

“What appears to be a Y-8 military transport aircraft is at Fiery Cross Reef, another Chinese base in the [Philippines’] Spratly Islands south of the Paracels, as of Monday, after what looked to be a Type 904 supply ship stopped by last Friday,” according to the report.

China’s PLA has conducted an increasing number of exercises in or near the South China Sea recently. According to RFA, the tempo of the military drills “is rising this week, with three exercises around the same time. Live-fire drills began off the coast of Qingdao [on the shore of China’s Yellow Sea coast] on Saturday and are set to end on Wednesday, and China is also currently in the middle of an exercise in Bohai Bay [located in the innermost gulf of the Yellow Sea] that began last Friday and runs until this Friday.”","China Says Military Helicopter Is 'Amphibious,' Hinting at Taiwan Threat",fake

Police have reportedly handcuffed some residents to buildings for trying to escape quarantine.

Xinjiang is known as the home of China’s oppressed minority Uyghur population. Its capital, Urumqi, has been in a CCP-declared “wartime state” of lockdown for over a month since authorities detected a cluster of new coronavirus cases there in July, the Guardian reported.

China has built hundreds of concentration camps in Xinjiang in which survivors say Uyghurs and other Muslim ethnic minorities face torture, forced sterilization, slavery, and potential organ harvesting, as well as communist indoctrination and forced rejection of their faith.

Since Friday, people in Urumqi have inundated Chinese social media platforms with complaints about the extreme local quarantine measures. Some internet users claimed police chained them to buildings after seeing them attempt to leave their homes without the CCP’s permission. Australia’s ABC News published video footage on Tuesday allegedly showing Urumqi residents handcuffed to railings outside buildings in the capital.

One person on Chinese social media said Communist Party officials forced them to stay in a coronavirus quarantine center for two months, according to the Guardian. Several people say they have been required to take the Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) Lianhua Qingwen, an herbal remedy the CCP has been promoting as an unproven treatment for coronavirus, according to ABC.

Video clips posted to Chinese social media platforms Weibo and WeChat over the weekend allegedly capture Urumqi residents screaming from their apartment windows, frustrated at being forced to remain inside their homes during the quarantine.

“‘Open the door,’ some of the people can be heard yelling,” ABC translated in one of the video clips.

Although the video footage has not been independently verified, “a notice posted online from one residential compound [in Urumqi] warned that anyone who participated in the ‘roaring’ activity on August 23 had committed an ‘illegal act’,” the Guardian noted.

CCP officials continue to enforce a strict lockdown on the regional capital, in place since July, despite claiming that Urumqi has not recorded any new coronavirus cases in the past eight days. Prior to this claim, Urumqi had officially documented over 531 coronavirus cases by mid-August, according to the report.",Report: China Handcuffing Uyghurs to Buildings in Virus Lockdown,fake

The protests have drawn support from the German far right.

Officials said that those protesting would likely have breached rules on social distancing designed to stop the spread of the virus. Germany has seen an upswing in infections in recent weeks and the government is considering whether to impose fresh restrictions again.

Authorities in the capital cited a rally against COVID-19 restrictions on Aug. 1 during which participants ignored mask-wearing and distancing rules and other conditions imposed on the protest.

Berlin’s top security official, Andreas Geisel, welcomed the decision.

“We need to weigh the basic right of freedom of assembly against the sanctity of life,” he said in a statement. “We chose life.”

Geisel said police would act to stop any large gathering of people and indicated that authorities wouldn’t tolerate a tent camp that protesters have erected near the German parliament.

“I’m not prepared to accept that Berlin is abused a second time as a stage for corona deniers … and right-wing extremists,” he said.

Numerous leading figures in the country’s far-right scene, including members of the Alternative for Germany party, had announced they would participate in rallies in Berlin on Saturday.

The party’s leader in the Berlin state assembly, Georg Pazderski, criticized the decision to ban the protests, calling it disproportionate and unjustified.

In an unprecedented message via Twitter, the official account of the U.S. Embassy sent out a meme of CCP General Secretary Xi Jinping with a text stating: “The Chinese Communist Party is stealing American technology and intellectual property to build its military and economic power.”

Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi arrived in Rome Tuesday to meet with his Italian counterpart Luigi Di Maio. In March, 2019, Italy became the first large European economy to join China’s international infrastructure project, the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).

According to Italy’s ANSA news service, the purpose of Wang’s Rome visit is to “court the EU against Trump’s America.”

Wang himself said he is undertaking a tour of the European capitals, beginning with Italy, to strengthen relations between China and the European Union in the face of unspecified “external forces” that threaten “provocation and damage” to these relations.

In a press conference Tuesday, Wang pointed the finger at the “wind of unilateralism and the Cold War” that he feels blowing in the world, a movement that China “does not intend to allow.”

ANSA called Wang’s comment “a thinly veiled reference to Donald Trump’s United States.”

Wang presented the current U.S. administration as lukewarm if not openly hostile towards the EU, while China was “an always reliable friend,” insisting that “a united, stable and prosperous Europe is important for the whole world.”

The Chinese minister also promised assistance to help overcome the coronavirus pandemic and also to cope with the consequences of the economic crisis, a situation felt acutely in Italy.

For his part, Italian foreign minister Luigi di Maio said that Italy intends to play “a bridging role” between the colliding superpowers. While reiterating that the country “will keep faith with its historical alliances,” namely the United States and NATO, Di Maio added that “China is now an unavoidable player on any international scenario” and an important partner for Italy.

Italy, the minister said, “has a clear international position: alliances do not vary and are firmly and stronger than ever,” which permits “a healthy and loyal relationship” based on “frankness.”

Wang’s Rome visit has also sparked debate over the renewal of the controversial China-Vatican deal over the naming of Catholic bishops in China.

The Chinese minister is expected to meet with Holy See representatives during his brief stay in Rome to continue discussions started in Munich last February with Vatican Archbishop Paul Gallagher, his counterpart.

The secret provisional accord between the Holy See and the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), whose details have never been made public, was signed on September 22, 2018 and is due to be renegotiated and renewed next month.

Last June, Vatican Archbishop Claudio Maria Celli, the head of the delegation in relations with the Chinese government, said on Italian television that the accord will likely be renewed this September.

“Dialogue with China is not an easy path but we have embarked on a path made of respect, attention, and mutual understanding to resolve the knots that remain and the situations that leave us more than thoughtful, I would say worried,” said the archbishop.

“I think we will probably have to reconfirm it for another 1-2 years, but still the Holy See has not made a decision on this matter which will then be communicated to the Chinese authorities,” he said. “However, the climate is positive, and there is an atmosphere of respect, clarity, co-responsibility, and foresight.”

“We try to look to the future and try to give the future of our relationships a deep, respectful basis and I would say that we are working in this direction,” he said.

Following his Italian visit, Wang will travel on to Holland, Norway, France, and Germany.

One of China’s most senior diplomats made the claim as he categorically refused to acknowledge the virus originated in Wuhan.

Wang Xining, the deputy head of mission at China’s embassy in Australia, gave a rare address at the National Press Club in Canberra, where he said Australia’s focus on determining the origins of the virus had damaged international relations and crushed China’s populace.

“It hurts the feelings of the Chinese people … All of a sudden, they heard this shocking news of a proposal coming from Australia, which is supposed to be a good friend of China,” Wang said, according to SBS News.

Australia was one of the first countries to push the World Health Assembly, the governing body of the World Health Organization, for a “comprehensive, independent and impartial” investigation into the source of the coronavirus pandemic.

As Breitbart News reported, other countries rallied behind the call, however China appears not to have forgiven Canberra for voicing its opinion and challenging Beijing on the diplomatic stage.

﻿

Wang acknowledged China’s hurt, saying he believed Australia’s early push was unfair, because it had been advanced on the presumption that Wuhan was the source of the virus.

“We believe this proposal was targeted against China alone, because during that time Australian ministers claimed that the virus originated from Wuhan, from China, and they did not pinpoint any other places as a possible source,” he said.

“We don’t think it was fair.”

The Australians have also been among the most outspoken critics of China’s dangerous refusal to close the live animal “wet markets” seen as spawning grounds for the viral pandemic, and of the World Health Organization’s (W.H.O.) baffling endorsement of their reopening.

This is not the first time China has hinted at trade repercussions by China against Australia.

There were warnings by China’s ambassador to Australia, Jingye Cheng, back in April that Australia would pay an economic price over its inquiry call, a move described by an Australian minister at the time as “threats of economic coercion.”

Cheng said Australia’s support for the inquiry could result in Chinese tourists having second thoughts about visiting.

“Maybe the ordinary people will say ‘Why should we drink Australian wine? Eat Australian beef?’” he told the Australian Financial Review.

An editorial in the Global Times followed that up and accused Australia of “panda bashing” and victim blaming, saying “adventurism” which could damage the bilateral relationship “beyond repair.”

Beijing took the same approach when Australia became the first country aside from the U.S. to block China’s Huawei telecom giant from supplying equipment for its 5G network.

The latest diplomatic row is seen as an extension of that blow to China’s global standing and reflects its disdain for Australia daring to oppose Beijing.","Australia 'Hurt the Feelings' of China with Call for Coronavirus Inquiry, Diplomat Complains",fake

Lebanon’s government resigned amid accusations of entrenched corruption and negligence after the Aug. 4 explosion that killed nearly 200 people, wounded nearly 6,000 and devastated entire districts of Beirut. The explosion was the result of more than 2,750 tons of improperly stored ammonium nitrate igniting at the port, although the cause of the fire that ignited them is still unknown.

The catastrophic blast comes on top of an unprecedented economic and financial crisis, a currency crash and hyperinflation — the culmination of decades of endemic corruption and mismanagement by a ruling class that has refused to reform or step down.

Western nations have been demanding major reforms in the tiny country in return for help and some countries have been sending aid directly to the people rather than state institutions notorious for corruption.

“This country is on the brink,” Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said on RTL radio, citing growing poverty, unemployment and inflation. “The risk today is the disappearance of Lebanon” if it doesn’t urgently form a government and institute reforms.

Next week, President Emmanuel Macron is making a three-day trip to Lebanon, a former French protectorate. He will offer French support after the devastating port explosion earlier this month, but also ensure that millions in international aid go to those who need it.

“We will not sign a blank check for a government that does not implement reforms,” notably of public services and the banking system, Le Drian said.

Canadian Minister of Foreign Affairs Francois-Philippe Champagne, who is in Beirut, also said reforms are badly needed in the country adding that Canada is ready to take part in the investigation of the port blast.

So far 19 people, most of them port and customs officials, have been arrested, and are being questioned by prosecutors.

Champagne told reporters that he discussed with the outgoing defense minister an “understanding on the conditions that the Royal Canadian Mounted Police will participate in the investigation.” Two Canadian citizens were killed in the explosion.

He added that Canada is more than happy to work under conditions that “our assistance will give faith to the Lebanese people that this is an investigation that will go to the bottom of things.” He said the details are yet to be defined.

“This blast is the tragedy of all tragedies. It embodies all the tragedies that we have seen in decades in Lebanon,” Champagne said. “Impunity needs to cease, reforms need to take place and I would say leaders need to listen.”","France Warns Lebanon Faces Collapse After Explosion, Political Crisis",fake

Virtually every administration official except President Michel Aoun resigned soon after the August 4 explosion that devastated the city of Beirut.

The search for a new prime minister appears to be deadlocked by Lebanon’s factional rivalries and resistance to reform, even as the country’s already shaky economy teeters on the edge of utter ruin.

Reuters noted on Wednesday that Lebanon was a disaster area before the explosion, with hyperinflation devouring the currency and the banking system melting down. The current air of political chaos is making it that much harder for the country to obtain outside financial support, including from the International Monetary Fund (IMF).

“It is very dangerous now. We were at a crossroads: either the right path or continuing going down the road to no IMF, no international aid, no money. This is pushing Lebanon towards chaos, complete collapse,” warned the Lebanese central bank, noting that it only has enough financial resources to keep food, fuel, and medicine flowing into the country for three more months.

After that, Lebanon would probably have to begin cannibalizing its gold reserves to survive. Lebanon’s cash reserves were valued at $30 billion in November when the central bank was struggling to convince depositors their money was secure. If the cash reserves will only sustain vital supplies and industries for three months, the $18 billion in gold reserves probably will not keep them afloat for much longer. The damage from the Beirut explosion has been estimated at $7 to $15 billion, so it could devour the value of those gold reserves with only a little left over for food and medicine.

Former Prime Minister Hassan Diab essentially pronounced Lebanon ungovernable and unreformable when he resigned a week after the Beirut blast, gravely judging the corrupt establishment to be “bigger than the state” itself.

“I hope that the caretaking period will not be long because the country cannot take that. Lets hope a new government will be formed quickly. An effective government is the least we need to get out of this crisis,” public works minister Michel Najjar said after Diab resigned. That hope appears to have been dashed.

Most of the officials who resigned are actually still sitting in their offices as caretakers, including Diab, and they might be sitting there for at least another year. Filling out a successor government has been stymied by the usual standoff of factional interests, as Reuters described:

Hezbollah and its Shia ally Amal are pressing for the return of Saad Hariri, seeing him as well placed to galvanize foreign support. But this has hit resistance from several parties, each for their own reasons. The opponents include Hezbollah’s ally the Maronite Christian President Michel Aoun and his son-in-law, Free Patriotic Movement leader Gebran Bassil, who have been at loggerheads with Hariri since last year. At the other end of the spectrum, neither the Christian Lebanese Forces Party, seen as close to Saudi Arabia, nor Druze leader Walid Joumblatt want him back in the job for now. “If it isn’t Saad Hariri, we will remain with a caretaker government” until the end of Aoun’s term in 2022, said a senior politician familiar with the thinking of Hezbollah and Amal.

For his part, Hariri is either uninterested in the job or holding out for a deal that would ostensibly break the factional deadlock and allow him to rebuild the government with a cabinet of independent experts.

The problem with his apparent enthusiasm for reform is that the other factions would justifiably expect his cabinet of “non-aligned experts” to swiftly align itself with Hezbollah’s interests. Hezbollah is still hell-bent on starting a war with Israel, so its interests include bombs, guns, missiles, terrorist foot soldiers, and other things the people of Lebanon cannot eat.

“Now, after three weeks, there has been nothing; we don’t know who is in charge. Not one of the current elite has moved one inch. No one is asking ‘what is it that we have to do?’ No one is proposing anything,” a former minister complained to Reuters.

September 1 will mark the 100-year anniversary of the State of Greater Lebanon, controlled by France until gaining independence in 1943. It is not looking like a happy anniversary.

Some gloomy older Lebanese told Reuters the factional stalemates and pervasive corruption of today can be traced back to the slapdash founding of the nation, which threw several antagonistic groups together and marked out factional political territory right from the start. It seemed to be working for half a century, and then the car bombs started going off.

The biggest of those bombs took out Rafik al-Hariri, Saad’s father and perhaps the last leader who had a shot at forming a durable Lebanese national identity. Now the grudges are never forgotten, and every faction clings to its power and patronage with a white-knuckled grip, fearful of making itself vulnerable by making any concessions to reform.

Hezbollah is the most powerful of those factions. It absolutely refuses to take any responsibility for the explosion at the port it controls, while its critics want the international community to condition rescue plans for Lebanon on getting Hezbollah out of power.

“For all intents and purposes, the failed Lebanese state has become a puppet of Hezbollah and its patrons in Tehran,” said a letter to the IMF from an Israeli non-governmental organization called Shurat Hadin on Thursday.

“Hezbollah is clearly moving to control the Central Bank through its Health Ministry with the fourth largest budget in the government as well as the Communication, Agriculture, and Water ministries,” warned Shurat Hadin, which represents victims of Hezbollah terrorism in both the U.S. and Israel.

The letter warned that sending billions of dollars in rescue money to Lebanon without breaking Hezbollah’s grip on the financial system would amount to international support for the Iran-backed terrorist group.

“The IMF is on notice that any funds it provides to Lebanon will be targeted by the victims of Hezbollah’s terrorism to enforce their court ordered judgments. Any banking institutions in Lebanon or abroad that transfers IMF funds to Hezbollah will be sued in relevant jurisdictions for aiding and abetting terrorism,” Shurat Hadin warned.

Hezbollah stated once again on Wednesday that it has no intention of relinquishing power, rejecting any political conditions on IMF support as an infringement on Lebanese sovereignty.

Every attempt to cobble together a “national unity government” that would be acceptable to Hezbollah has been frowned upon by international financial donors, and frequently by Lebanese protesters, who want every trace of the government that blew up half of Beirut to disappear.

The IMF seems determined to at least secure a major reform of customs and import procedures, to ensure no other unpleasant surprises are lurking in Lebanese warehouses, but Hezbollah will never allow its smuggling operations to be disrupted. The IMF also wants a full audit of the Lebanese central bank, but Hezbollah is only one of several powerful interests that do not want the books combed over by independent auditors. Just about every significant reform proposal is a non-starter to someone with the power to scuttle any bailout deal.

The French government produced a two-page outline for a comprehensive reform plan on Thursday, a document described as ambitious but “informal.” A central bank audit was reportedly one of the French action items, plus early elections to form a new government and a comprehensive, “impartial” investigation of the Beirut explosion.

The 30-year-old composer says he was arrested two weeks ago in northern Iran over his latest project, which includes both women vocalists and dancers, who are effectively banned in Iran.

According to a Rajabian, security police arrested him on August 10 and took him straight to court, where the judge accused him of “encouraging prostitution.”

“This regime wants to stifle my voice,” Rajabian told the BBC. “They insist that I stop playing music.”

Mehdi Rajabian–who has already been imprisoned twice in #Iran on charges relating to his music–is now facing trial for working with female singers and dancers. Story here: https://t.co/B3rjZK4QHr. Tell @Khamenei_fa to stop trying to crush artistic freedom. #Rights4Iran pic.twitter.com/01D4yaiHag — IranHumanRights.org (@ICHRI) August 27, 2020

He was released after his family posted his bail. Iranian officials ordered him to stop producing music until his trial.

“If I make music, they will immediately remove my bail,” he continued. “I have to wait for the day of judgment for now.”

The arrest reportedly came after he gave an interview to the BBC about his upcoming album, as well as the publication of a video featuring the famous Iranian classical dancer Helia Bandeh interpreting his music.

Under Iran’s Islamic law, singers and dancers are subject to prosecution if the regimes consider their acts to be “indecent” or “immoral.” Women are only ever allowed to perform in a choir or as a vocalist for a female-only audience, although they must first receive explicit permission from authorities.

It is not the first time that Rajabian has faced persecution for his musical activities, having twice faced imprisonment for similar charges. In 2013, he forced into solitary confinement for three months, and in 2015 he was given a year six-year prison sentence as well as a permanent ban on musical activities.

Authorities eventually released him after he went on a hunger strike that attracted the attention of the world’s media and human rights organizations. His activities remain closely monitored by the regime.

“Coronavirus days are a normal day for me because I have been completely alone at home for years,” he said. “It was as if I had been transferred from a smaller prison to a larger one. Now the pressure is on me not to even produce another work of art. It means complete death. In general, their plan is my complete destruction.”

The case underlines the staggering levels of censorship and repression imposed by Tehran’s theocratic regime, which regularly cracks down on free expression even if it is non-political.

“Iranian law vaguely defines what constitutes acts against morality, and authorities have long censored art, music, and other forms of cultural expression, as well as prosecuted hundreds of people for such acts,” noted the New York NGO Human Rights Watch. “These laws often disproportionally target women and sexual minorities.”

He was part of the president’s inner circle, accused by the United States of exploiting his proximity to power to enrich himself ‘at the expense of ordinary Syrians.’ His business empire spanned telecoms, energy, real estate, and hotels, looming large over Syria’s economy,” Al Arabiya noted.

Now, Assad and Makhlouf are at odds over money. This year, Syrian security forces began raiding Makhlouf’s telecoms company, Syriatel, in a tax dispute. Police detained dozens of Syriatel’s employees for questioning over “fund transfers to front companies set up by Makhlouf in the British Virgin Islands and Jersey,” a Damascus banker with knowledge of the matter told Reuters.

With Syria’s economy imploding following years of war, Assad has recently pushed to confiscate the billions of dollars held by Makhlouf in offshore companies. For several years, Makhlouf has allegedly been building his own private wealth behind the president’s back through shell companies despite “acting as Assad’s trusted money keeper and family treasurer” for decades, according to the report.

“Makhlouf would buy supplies and equipment for the government from companies that he ultimately owns. He would create these shell companies that would be suppliers,” a shareholder in Makhlouf’s real estate developer, Cham Holding, and former Makhlouf associate told Reuters.

“A former business associate and a banker said Makhlouf had created a network of front companies, including in neighboring Lebanon, where he generated his own money separate from the funds Assad asked him to place in safe havens on behalf of the ruling family. They didn’t quantify the sums of money involved,” the report stated.

In a social media post on July 26, Makhlouf admitted to setting up such firms, insisting that “these companies’ role and aim is to circumvent sanctions,” not self-enrichment.",Syria: Bashar al-Assad’s Cousin and Finance Manager Turns Against Him,fake

The Turkish navy said it would stage “gunnery exercises”along the bounadary of it territorial waters in the northeastern corner of the Mediterranean Sea in the middle of next week.

Defence Minister Hulusi Akar warned the drills were “security related” and were in no way connected to Turkey’s unrelenting search for natural gas that has pitted it against Greece and the European Union.

The two NATO members have been staging rival war games in a conflict that could imperil Europe’s access to vast new energy deposits and further destabilise war-torn Libya and parts of the Middle East.

The Turkish defence minister did not say whether the Oruc Reis research vessel and its accompanying navy frigates would leave waters claimed by Greece on Thursday as planned.

But he warned: “There’s neither a deadline nor a limit” to Turkish exercises and exploration in the eastern Mediterranean.

“They will be carried out as much as they are needed … We are determined to protect our rights.”

As Breitbart London reported, Greece and Turkey have been at loggerheads since the Turkish research vessel Oruc Reis last month set sail for an area in the Mediterranean to conduct research.

Greece responded by putting its forces on alert, while Turkey despatched warships of its own to escort the Oruc Reis.

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan claimed without evidence the Greek navy “attacked” the research vessel, but that was played down by Greek media who instead pointed to a minor collision between the two.

Turkey Claims Greece Attacked Research Vessel and Tells France to Back Off https://t.co/2EexqoQ9AV — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) August 15, 2020

Meanwhile French frigates and fighter jets joined Greek war games — also including Italy and Crete — on Wednesday while Turkey staged smaller ones nearby with a U.S. navy ship.

The French intervention has particularly upset an increasingly bellicose Turkey which in some ways is mimicking the aggressive actions of China as it uses it naval presence to help Beijing claim all of the South China Sea – natural resources included.

“The time for bullying is over. You have no chance to force (us) to take some actions through bullying,” Akar told France in a televised interview.

“It’s an empty dream to think about preventing or changing the activities of Turkey or the Turkish armed forces,” he said of the French military presence in the region.

“Some are in the process, some already got (the documents), but we are talking about around a dozen,” says Roey Gilad, chargé d’affaires at Israel’s Embassy in Turkey, according to Reuters.

According to Gilad, Israel has evidence to that end.

“We have already one document that we will present to the government in copy,” he said. “Judging by the last experience we had by presenting a well-based portfolio to the government… and getting no reply, I must say I don’t have high hopes that something will be done this time.”

He added the Hamas members receiving Turkish passports were financing and organizing “terror-related activity” in Istanbul, but Turkey had not taken action.

According to Gilad, many of them came to Turkey under the 2011 prisoner exchange deal between Hamas and Israel to exchange captured Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit for more than 1,000 prisoners.

A senior regional source told the Telegraph that seven some of the Hamas members are living in Turkey under aliases. Citizenship has also been granted to the families of the Hamas members, the paper said.

“These are not foot soldiers but the most senior Hamas operatives outside of Gaza,” the source told the paper, adding they are are “actively raising funds and directing operatives to carry out attacks in the present day.”

“The Turkish Government gave in to pressure by Hamas to grant citizenship to its operatives, thereby allowing them to travel more freely, endangering other countries that have listed Hamas as a terror group.”

One of the cell members who has apparently received citizenship is Zacharia Najib, who was responsible for a plot to assassinate high-ranking Israeli officials, including the national police commissioner and Likud MK Nir Barkat, who was then mayor of Jerusalem.

Turkish citizens can already travel visa-free to a range of countries, the Telegraph noted, adding that Turkey is working to obtain a similar privilege to European Union countries.

The U.S. State Department on Tuesday strongly objected to a weekend meeting in Istanbul between Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and a delegation of senior Hamas leaders, including wanted terrorists.

State Department spokesperson Morgan Ortagus said Hamas chief Ismail Haniyeh and deputy chief Saleh al-Arouri are designated by the U.S. and European Union as “Specially Designated Global Terrorists.”

Al-Arouri, who has a $5 million bounty on his head from U.S. authorities, is wanted for his ties to several terror attacks, kidnappings and hijackings, including the 2014 kidnapping and murder of three Israeli teenagers — one with U.S. citizenship — in the West Bank, which he praised as a “heroic operation.” Ortagus said in a statement:

President Erdoğan’s continued outreach to this terrorist organization only serves to isolate Turkey from the international community, harms the interests of the Palestinian people, and undercuts global efforts to prevent terrorist attacks launched from Gaza. We continue to raise our concerns about the Turkish government’s relationship with Hamas at the highest levels. This is the second time President Erdogan has welcomed Hamas leadership to Turkey this year with the first meeting occurring February 1.

The response came as Secretary of State Mike Pompeo left Jerusalem for Khartoum in Sudan for the second leg of his Middle East tour.

The condemnation marks a departure from U.S. policy, which for years has ignored Ankara’s ongoing support for the terrorist group.

According to The Jerusalem Post, this is because the U.S. has traditionally sought closer ties with Turkey as “part of wishful thinking that [it] would turn away from Iran and Russia and work with the US on regional issues.”

The meeting also included Hamas’ overseas leader Maher Salah, Hamas head of Arab and Islamic religions, Ezzat al-Rihiq, and Hamas representative in Turkey, Jihad Yaghmor.",Turkey Grants Citizenship to a Dozen Senior Hamas Terrorists and Their Families,fake

On Sunday, following comments depicting Sarsour as an outsider with condemnable views, the 40-year-old Palestinian-American rabblerouser placed Biden’s campaign on alert as she announced that she is a not a “fringe” or “marginal” voice in the progressive community, with the majority of progressives supporting her views on Palestinian human rights and the “constitutional right to engage in the Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions [BDS] movement.”

Sarsour added that any condemnation of her is an attack on the larger progressive wing. “We are the current Democratic Party. We are the future of the Democratic Party,” she said. “The Democratic Party needs me and the communities that I come from more than we need them.”

Criticism of Sarsour also drew the ire of numerous Arab and Muslim activists and groups, including many that had pledged support for Biden, as well as a slew of progressive organizations and individuals, resulting in a petition that has so far garnered much support.

As a result, in an effort to avoid more controversy, Biden campaign officials rushed to assure their radical allies that the Biden campaign was with them, issuing apologies for the “egregious misstep.”

The apologies were no small matter, as the campaign’s capitulation to the most extreme elements on the left is a sure sign of what awaits in the event of a Democratic win this election.

However, despite the apologies, the Biden campaign’s less-than-dramatic attempt to quell the outrage did little to satisfy critics on the far left, who have called for the acceptance of Sarsour and a full and open retraction.

Sarsour, who has a history of racist and antisemitic behavior and statements, is an organizer for Black Lives Matter (BLM) and was arrested on Tuesday along with over 60 others during a large-scale demonstration protesting the death of Breonna Taylor.

Sarsour also works closely with scores of other progressive organizations.

A member of the Democratic Socialists of America and a popular figure in Arab and Muslim circles, Sarsour half-heartedly endorsed Biden only after he had selected Sen. Kamala Harris as a running mate. “It’s no secret that I have disagreements with both VP Joe Biden & Senator Kamala Harris,” she tweeted after the announcement. “But I know what I need to do – Elect the Biden-Harris ticket and prepare to hold them accountable in the White House.”

In the past, Sarsour worked with the notorious racist Louis Farrakhan, speaking at a Nation of Islam event and defending his organization.

As reported by Breitbart News, Sarsour, a leader of the BDS movement against Israel, has called for “jihad” (Islamic holy war) against Trump, while urging Muslims to declare that opposing Trump is a religious duty under Islam.

Last Tuesday, Sarsour addressed the DNC convention in a caucus meeting for Muslim Delegates and Allies Assembly, stating the Democratic Party “is absolutely our party in this moment.”

President Trump’s campaign was quick to condemn her appearance, saying that Biden endorsed her “extreme bigotry,” leading Biden’s campaign to distance itself from the Palestinian-American radical.

“Joe Biden has been a strong supporter of Israel and a vehement opponent of antisemitism his entire life, and he obviously condemns her [Sarsour’s] views and opposes BDS, as does the Democratic platform,” campaign spokesperson Andrew Bates said in a statement on Tuesday. “She has no role in the Biden campaign whatsoever.”

Claiming that she was condemned as part of “a majority of Arab-American, Palestinian American and Muslim American communities” that carry the same views, Sarsour noted her surprise at the criticism as she boasted of being at the forefront of fighting the Trump administration “from day one.”

Taking to Twitter, she warned the Biden campaign spokesperson directly her Muslim community’s votes won’t be taken for granted.

“@AndrewBatesNC, just came here to remind you that you need a coalition to defeat Donald Trump and that Muslim Americans are an important voter bloc in key states like Michigan, Wisconsin, Virginia, Texas, Pennsylvania & I know a little something about how to organize them,” she wrote.

Radicals rally in defense of Sarsour

Radical anti-Israel organizations, including the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), the Arab American Institute (AAI) and the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee (ADC) urged the Biden campaign to retract its statement.

CAIR, a Muslim advocacy group accused of having ties to terror organizations, described the “smearing” of Sarsour as “predictable, despicable and unacceptable” in a strongly worded statement in her defense, while CAIR’s executive director, Zahra Billoo, stated that “the opinions that Linda is being attacked for are held arguably by a majority of the Muslim community.”

In addition, a group of Palestinian-American Democratic delegates demanded an “immediate retraction” of the campaign’s statement against Sarsour.

“This disavowal of Linda Sarsour reeks of misogyny, anti-Muslim and anti-Palestinian bigotry. It provides a false shield for Israel’s human rights abuses,” the delegates said in a statement.

“Squad” member Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Minn.) expressed her frustration of having to witness the vilification of Sarsour yet again. “I am so sick and tired of folks going after Linda Sarsour and other Palestinian activists for speaking the truth about oppression and injustice,” she wrote.

Many other progressive groups and individuals have also come to Sarsour’s defense.

Dream Defenders, the Israel-boycott-promoting and anti-police organization where Sarsour serves as an advisory board member, stated that they “stand with their inspirational “sister” and “comrade.”

MoveOn, a Soros-funded anti-Republican PAC, called the Muslim activist a “leader in the fight for justice for all of us” and called for the Biden campaign to welcome progressives and Muslim and Arab Americans “even where policy disagreements exist.”

Emgage Action, a Soros-backed Muslim advocacy group which bills itself as the largest Muslim PAC in the country and cohosts a conference that has drawn speakers who referred to homosexuality as a “disease” and defended terrorist groups, put out a statement claiming they were “very concerned” about the comments made against Sarsour and demanded a “speedy and genuine retraction.”

CODEPINK tweeted that it stood with Sarsour and “every brave activist who speaks up for Palestinian human rights.”

DSA BDS and Palestine Solidarity, the national working group for Democratic Socialist members involved in BDS, expressed solidarity with their “comrade” Sarsour, claiming “they smear us because they are threatened by us and the power of our movement.”

In a thread calling attention to Sarsour’s activism, Bend The Arc: Jewish Action, a movement of tens of thousands of pro-BDS progressive Jews all across the country, tweeted that the nearly 160 far-left members of the Jewish community “from a range of backgrounds, experiences, and political perspectives” who condemned attacks on Sarsour in the past, stand with her now.

“Linda, we have your back and we’re grateful you’ve had ours,” the group added.

Far-left CPD Action stated that they “continue to support Linda” for she has “consistently championed the issues that matter most to our communities.”

The Soros-backed anti-Israel Jewish Voice for Peace Action launched a petition demanding the Biden campaign issue a public apology.

Calling the condemnation of Sarsour “unstrategic,” the petition asserts that the Democratic Party needs to build coalitions “with Palestinian Americans, Muslims and those fighting for Palestinian rights,” while Sarsour and her vision “represents the future we all need.”

“Don’t think you can viciously smear a prominent member of our community – one who has been tirelessly working for social justice for all communities – then talk about and expect our support,” Palestinian-American activist Huwaida Arraf wrote.

Medicare for All activist and featured Democratic Convention speaker Ady Barkan tweeted his outrage at the criticism of Sarsour as he characterized the Biden statement as “vile and dishonest,” only one day after Biden thanked him for his efforts to “ensure a more just, more equal America.”

‘Egregious misstep’

As outrage grew among progressives, a fearful Biden campaign leadership sought to assuage their concerns.

In an off-the-record virtual meeting with prominent activists on Sunday, Ashley Allison, national coalitions director for the Biden campaign, stated she was sorry for comments critical of Sarsour made by a campaign spokesman.

“I am sorry that that happened,” she said while expressing her hope to help “build back the trust” of Arabs and Muslims pained by the disavowal of Sarsour.

Senior Biden adviser Symone Sanders referred to the criticism of Sarsour as an “egregious misstep” that harmed the work that Muslim advocates have done to mobilize the community to vote in the upcoming election while promising that such criticism would never recur.

“We are not in the business of condemning people and large swathes of the community,” she reiterated.

Biden flip-flops on BDS

Despite Biden’s campaign site pledging to “firmly reject the BDS movement” in an address to the Jewish community, Sanders stressed that the campaign recognises the “constitutional right to free speech on issues like BDS.”

At the meeting, Biden’s top foreign policy adviser, Tony Blinken, also expressed regret over the comments.

“Historically, Republicans and Democrats have been quick to dismiss Muslim, Arab-American and especially Palestinian-American voices, and I want to reiterate on behalf of all of us our support for your communities,” Blinken told the activists, as he pledged that the Biden campaign and future administration would ensure Arab and Muslim representation at the decision-making level.

However, despite the efforts, the Biden campaign’s apologies were deemed inadequate.

Palestinian-American president of New Generation for Palestine, Amer Zahr, said the Biden aides’ remarks during the meeting were not enough, calling for a public apology to Sarsour instead.

“A private apology, where Linda Sarsour was not even present, simply does not suffice for a very public attack on her and our community,” Zahr told Middle East Eye (MEE). “If they expect our community to simply accept this backroom stuff, I’m afraid they will be unpleasantly surprised.”

Calls for the Democratic Party to accept radical figures such as Sarsour are part of a larger aim of progressive leaders and activists who continue to criticize party policies deemed too centrist.

As a result of the latest fiasco with Sarsour as well as other moves on the part of the Biden campaign, many threatened that such moves would only work in Trump’s favor.

“If Joe Biden ignores, demoralizes, or actively alienates his progressive base,” wrote Amy Goodman and Denis Moynihan for Democracy Now! on Thursday, “he could pave the way for another Donald Trump victory.”

An essay in Black Star News warned that “the Biden Harris campaign could end up handing the presidency to the White supremacist president on a silver platter unless a quick corrective action is taken by way retraction of the false statement [condemning Sarsour].”

“There is a realistic chance that November’s presidential election may be decided by who wins Michigan. In 2016, President Donald Trump won the Midwestern state by a mere 10,000 votes. Michigan also happens to be home to large Arab and Muslim communities – a constituency in the hundreds of thousands that could sway the election one way or another,” wrote Ali Harbos of MME.

Imam Khalid Latif, executive director of the Islamic Center at New York University, reiterated that in the upcoming presidential election, “Muslims make up a key constituency in various swing states that Democrats will need in order to win.”

As far-left progressives continue to prod the Democratic Party into adopting their objectives, radicals are already foreseeing victory as they continue to behold a Biden campaign which is desperate for their support.

Founder and senior editor of Mondoweiss.net Philip Weiss welcomes the recent “growth of the congressional Squad” as the “fringe” that is “expanding by the day.”

While describing Biden as “old and conservative,” Weiss predicts that “as soon as Biden is in the White House (fingers crossed), the progressives will be all over him. And they are the future.”

With a Democratic Party whose “big tent” is inclusive of those who continue to shift it leftward, his prediction seems all the more probable. As President Trump declared on Monday, if Biden were to win, the “American dream will be dead.”","Joe Biden Campaign Capitulates to Radicals, Sarsour",fake

Turkey has repeatedly targeted Sinjar for bombing because of the presence of members of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK), a Marxist, U.S.-designated terrorist organization that played a role in fighting the Islamic State in the area. The PKK helped local Yazidis establish a militia to prevent another attempted genocide and vowed in 2017 not to leave the area until Yazidis had full, stable control of Sinjar.

The Islamist government of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan considers all groups allied with the PKK – such as the Yazidi militia they helped establish, the Sinjar Protection Units (YPS), and the U.S.-allied Syrian Kurdish People’s Protection Units (YPG/YPJ) – terrorist organizations and has consistently violated both Iraqi and Syrian sovereignty to attack them. Local officials in Sinjar confirmed to the Kurdish outlet Rudaw that airstrikes had occurred in the area.

“Khudeda Chuke, mayor of Sinune town, says a vehicle belonging to the Shingal Protection Units (YBS), a Yezidi armed group affiliated with the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) was hit in the vicinity of Bahraviyan village, seven kilometres west of the town of Khanasor,” Rudaw reported. Chuke said no casualties had occurred, but that the militia lost some equipment.

Kurdistan 24, an Iraqi Kurdish outlet, reported that another airstrike occurred late Tuesday that killed two civilians, citing “Iraq’s top security source.” The strike occurred in another village in Khanasor.

Members of the YBS issued an official statement confirming only that airstrikes occurred, but not offering any details, instead saying they would clarify what happened at a later date when they could fully assess the situation.

Turkey’s state-run Anadolu news agency confirmed Turkish military activity in Iraq on Tuesday, but claimed that the military had “neutralized” two “terrorists” in northern Iraq generally. “Neutralize” is a term Ankara typically uses that includes both those killed and removed from battle through arrest.

“The operation was carried out in the Zap region, across Turkey’s border, where the terrorists were planning an armed attack, according to a ministry statement,” Anadolu reported.

The Turkish Defense Ministry also claimed on Tuesday that it had destroyed PKK ammunition in “terrorist hideouts” in the area. Anadolu described the seizure as part of “Operation Claw-Eagle,” a military invasion of Iraq that Turkey launched in mid-June. Claw-Eagle consists of airstrikes on areas of Iraq that the Turkish government believes the PKK is active in, including areas like Sinjar, still largely destroyed after the Islamic State occupation there in 2014. The Turkish Defense Ministry claimed in June that Operation Claw-Eagle was necessary “to ensure the security of the Turkish people and the country’s borders by neutralizing the PKK and other terrorist organizations that have been stepping up harassment and attack attempts against the police and military bases.”

The bombing of Sinjar on Tuesday was the first of its kind since the first round of Claw-Eagle attacks in June, Rudaw noted, adding that it has documented the deaths of at least eight civilians at the hands of the airstrikes. After the first airstrikes, PKK news sources claimed that Turkey had bombed a hospital and refugee camp, not locations of military significance.

The few minority Christians left in the Sinjar area also protested following the first airstrikes that Turkish airstrikes were targeting their homes. Rudaw quoted a local Christian named Faiza Rahim saying in June that Turkish airstrikes blew up his car and that local Christians were “all terrified by the bombing, including children, women, men, and elderly.”

Turkey also launched an adjacent “Operation Claw-Tiger” operation in northern Iraq in June, a ground invasion of Iraq, prompting objections from both residents of northern Iraq’s autonomous Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) and the Iraqi government in Baghdad.

Sinjar faced the brunt of the Islamic State’s attempt to commit genocide against the Yazidi people in 2014. The invasion forced the residents of what was then Sinjar city to choose between confronting ISIS terrorists as they entered the city or fleeing to Mount Sinjar, which looms over the city. Many chose the latter, braving the dry mountain in hot August weather with no food or water. Many died of starvation, even as helicopter rescue missions came to try to fly them off of the mountain without having to come back down and face the jihadists.

When Kurdish forces finally defeated ISIS in Sinjar, they returned to rubble, mass graves, and little else. Bringing electricity or basic utilities to Sinjar was impossible even a year after the Islamic State left. Jihadists left booby traps and mines throughout the city to kill those returning should they lose control.

“Six years on, up to 200,000 Yazidis are still displaced. Some are still facing harsh conditions on Mount Sinjar, where they fled to escape, while the majority live in camps for internally displaced persons in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq,” the U.N. Development Programme noted in early August. “In addition to the human catastrophe, ISIL destroyed up to 80 percent of public infrastructure and 70 percent of civilian homes in Sinjar City and surrounding areas, as well as many important religious sites.”

The incident was described as a “collision” between military vehicles that did not involve “any exchange of fire,” and the resulting injuries were said to be “mild.”

Reuters’ sources evidently provided few details of the incident and there was no official comment from the Pentagon, but Russian television carried some footage of what was described as a “skirmish” between Russian and American military vehicles on August 24, while a few helicopters orbited overhead:

CNN talked to “several U.S. officials” who allegedly said a Russian vehicle deliberately colliding with American vehicles. These sources claimed that “a Russian military helicopter flew low and fast over the area in a tactic that is often used by military forces to try to disperse personnel on the ground.”

“One official emphasized that Tuesday’s incident occurred in the established security zone in eastern Syria where US and Syrian Democratic Forces regularly operate, adding that the Russians are aware they are under obligation to deconflict their operations with the US in that area,” CNN added.

Al-Monitor wrote on Tuesday that tensions are increasing between the Russians, soldiers, and militia loyal to the Syrian dictatorship Russia supports; Iran and its proxy fighters; invading Turkish troops and their militia allies; Turkey’s Kurdish adversaries the PKK; and the small force of Americans remaining in Syria.

According to Al-Monitor, continuing American support has emboldened the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) to resist “compromise with the forces of President Bashar al-Assad.”

Assad’s secret police are therefore allegedly attempting to provoke Arab tribes to stage an armed uprising against the Kurdish-led SDF, the Arab tribes are beginning to take violent action against “the American occupation and its mercenaries,” and the Russians are worried Assad is going to provoke a military confrontation with the SDF and United States that could end badly for Moscow’s interests.

Incumbent President Hassan Rouhani is completing his second four-year term and, under Iranian election laws, he is not eligible to run for a third.

Leaving office due to term limits is the most graceful exit Rouhani could hope for, as his popularity with both the Iranian people and the theocrats who control the Iranian government is very much in doubt. Rouhani won re-election in 2017 with over 50 percent of the vote, but much of 2020 has been filled with speculation that he could be impeached and forced out of office. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei shut down the impeachment effort in July and, now that the election schedule has been set by the Guardian Council, Rouhani will most likely reach the end of his second term.

Voice of America News offered a gloomy forecast for the Iranian election year:

Rouhani has been under increasing pressure from the U.S. sanctions since President Donald Trump two years ago pulled America out of the 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and world powers. The deal curbed Iran’s nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief. Trump also imposed severe sanctions on Iran, sending its economy into a downward spiral. Iran is now grappling also with the Trump administration’s push to impose so-called “snapback” sanctions over what Washington says is Iran’s violation of the nuclear deal. … Iran is also facing the Mideast region’s largest and deadliest outbreak of the coronavirus, with more than 361,000 registered cases, including 20,776 deaths.

Radio Farda noted that “unofficial campaigning for presidential election in Iran usually starts as early as the inauguration of the second term of the incumbent President,” but not this time thanks to the coronavirus, economic disaster, and constant protests against the regime.

Radio Farda nevertheless took a shot at handicapping the Iranian presidential race and came up with a few top-tier contenders, including newly-installed State Auditing Organization director Mehrdad Bazrpas, a former member of the brutal Basij militia; state television executive Ezatollah Zarghami; parliamentary speaker Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf; Parviz Fattah, head of the Mostazafan Foundation, essentially a giant development corporation styled as a religious charity; and Vice President for Scientific Affairs Surena Sattari.

Many of those top contenders are actively campaigning for the position. Most of them are presented as “young revolutionaries” who have some reform ideas, but also solid hardline credentials, usually including ties to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), the theocratic wing of the Iranian military and one of the most powerful forces in Iranian economics.

Other possible candidates include former president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who is becoming the Lyndon LaRouche of Iranian politics; former parliamentary speaker Ali Larijani, the longest-serving speaker and one of the most powerful politicians in Iran, although his influence waned considerably in recent years; Vice-President Es’haq Jahangiri; and Mohsen Hashemi Rafsanjani, head of the Tehran City Council, who frequently urges Iran’s many political factions to unite against the “external enemy” of the United States.

A notable dark horse candidate is Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, one of the best-known Iranian officials internationally and among the most respected members of Rouhani’s administration until recently, when the Iran nuclear deal failed to produce the benefits he anticipated and then the United States withdrew and reimposed sanctions.

Zarif has seemingly ruled out running for the presidency, although Radio Farda noted it is not uncommon for Iranian presidential contenders to change their minds after the elections are scheduled. Iranian election law stipulates that current officials who seek the presidency must resign from their positions three months before the election, so the firm deadline for making a decision will arrive in March.

Iranian Interior Minister Abdolreza Rahmani Fazli expressed concerns on Tuesday about the embarrassingly low turnout for parliamentary elections in February that could be repeated during the presidential race.

One of the reasons Iran’s outbreak of the Wuhan coronavirus was so widespread and deadly was the regime prodding people to ignore the pandemic and get out to vote, so turnout would not be so low; it still fell to the lowest levels in four decades. Fazli blamed low voter engagement levels in February on the pandemic but, in truth, most outside observers believe it was a deliberate show of no confidence in the Iranian government, driven by the killing of hundreds of protesters last year.

The clerical Guardian Council disqualifies most of the people who run for office in Iran, giving the theocracy a firm grip on true power. In 2020, the Guardian Council disqualified thousands of candidates for parliament, resulting in the lowest number of approved candidates in the history of the Islamic Republic and another major reason for the low voter turnout.

President Rouhani was outspokenly displeased by the high number of disqualifications, especially among reformists who might have become his political allies. Literally 99 percent of reform-minded candidates were blocked by the Guardian Council.

In the 2017 presidential election, over 1,600 people applied for candidacies but only six were approved by the Guardian Council, which struck down every female and non-Muslim applicant, along with every challenger to the Iranian political establishment. Former President Ahmadinejad was one of those disqualified after making a splashy surprise entry to the race at the last minute.",Iran Schedules June 18 Election for President Rouhani’s Successor,fake

Rana al-Dirani, whose father is the owner of the popular Em Nazih Cafe in Beirut, filmed herself swearing at police as he was dragged out of the building over concerns that it may collapse. She has since apologized for using expletives.

“We will be allowed to return upon completion of the building’s renovation,” Dirani wrote in a Facebook post, apologizing for using expletives at the Internal Security Forces Directorate (ISF). “Based on this, we apologize for these actions and the [curse] words directed at the ISF.”

The café was one of the thousands of buildings damaged during the recent explosion in Beirut, estimated to have caused around $15 billion in damages. Authorities believe that a cache of 2,750 tonnes of ammonium nitrate, a highly combustible chemical, caused the blast. The substance remained unsecured in a warehouse at the Port of Beirut since officials confiscated it from a seized ship in 2013, despite multiple requests by local officials to move it somewhere safer.

Outside of Beirut, Lebanon has been enduring a dire economic crisis for months, exacerbated by the ongoing Chinese coronavirus pandemic and strict lockdown measures imposed to allegedly prevent the virus from spreading further.

On Tuesday, Al Jazeera reported that merchants and business owners across the country plan to defy coronavirus lockdown measures, arguing they can no longer afford to stay closed amid the deepening economic crisis that began last year but has since been exacerbated by the explosion and the global pandemic.

“We will not be able to keep our stores closed for another day due to the terrible economic situation,” said Nicolas Chammas, chairman of the Beirut Traders Association, told the Qatari outlet. “We asked the government to weigh the economic costs as it did the health risks.”

Tony Rami, head of the syndicate of restaurant, cafe and club owners, announced that they too planned to ignore the lockdown orders to avoid excessive financial losses.

“We will not close our doors after today, nor will we pay a single penny before there is a new country that knows how to invest our money,” he said in a televised news conference. Civil disobedience has become an acquired and legitimate right. Our losses are estimated at $1 billion.”

“Israel views with utmost gravity the shooting at our forces by Hezbollah,” Netanyahu said in a statement.

“We will not tolerate any aggression against our citizens and we will respond forcefully to any attack against us. I suggest that Hezbollah not try the crushing force of Israel. Hezbollah is once again endangering Lebanon with its aggression.”

The report, entitled ‘How The British Media Reports Terrorism’, claimed that between 2015 and 2019, words or phrases identifying terrorists as Muslims are nine times more likely to be used in media reports than phrases identifying far-right or white-supremacist terrorist attacks.

The report also claimed that between October and December of 2018, one-quarter of online British media reports about Islam or Muslims were about terrorism or extremism.

Rizwana Hamid, the director of CfMM and one of the authors of the report, said according to The Times, that “inconsistencies remain, with a disproportionate focus on Muslims.”

She argued that “headlines using religious terms such as ‘Allahu Akbar’ imply that religion is always the motivator, ignoring other factors such as criminal history and mental health issues which may be at play, and which are often mentioned when the perpetrator is not Muslim.”

“Whilst there now appears to be a recognition of the importance of consistency and the scale of the far-right threat amongst the broadcasters, and most of the press, there is still a long way to go,” she said.

The Arabic phrase is often mistranslated in Western media as “God is great”, however, a more accurate translation would be “Allah is greater,” or “Allah Is Greater Than Your God or Government.”

Islamic State Remains ‘Most Significant Terrorist Threat to UK’: Defence Minister https://t.co/woogSChpry — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) July 24, 2020

The report laid out several recommendations for the media on how to report on terrorism including creating a consistent and transparent definition of what constitutes terrorism, avoid using the term “Allahu Akbar” as shorthand for a terrorist attack in headlines, and to not give platforms to supposed far-right or white supremacist voices.

“White-supremacist voices should only be platformed if their views can be adequately contextualised and challenged. An expert who is well versed with white supremacist thought should be used as an effective counterweight to challenge any claims such as the Great Replacement theory,” the report said.

“Classical Islamic scholars or notable academics could perform a similar role when myths on Islam and Muslims are being promulgated,” the report added.

82 Per Cent of Terrorist Prisoners in Europe Are Islamic Jihadists: Report https://t.co/RAEB12fREs — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) July 26, 2020

One reason for the disproportionate focus on Islamic terrorism and extremism may be a result of the scale of terrorism committed by Muslim extremists in the UK.

In May of 2019, the Director-General of MI5 Andrew Parker wrote that “of the multiple terrorist threats facing the UK, Islamist terrorism remains the most acute.”

Mr Parker noted that “in 2018, 80 per cent (of instances dealt with) were conducted by people inspired by the ideology of IS but who had never actually been in contact with it in Syria or Iraq.”

Britain’s Security Service also admitted in May of last year, that the number of far-right terrorist suspects is “absolutely dwarfed” by the number of Islamic related terror cases.

This is put into perspective when considering the fact that Britain’s white population around 50 million, compared to the Muslim population in Britain is approximately 3,370,000 according to 2018 Office for National Statists figures, suggesting that despite having a far larger population to recruit from, far-right groups are much less successful proportionally than Islamic radicals in gaining people to their Jihadi cause.

The brutal Iranian regime made an identical effort to take political advantage of the shooting of George Floyd in June.

“The murder and harassment of black Americans is not an exceptional case, rather it stems from a social racist mentality according to which a small group enjoys a very high status, but the rest are not entitled to lowest degree of civil rights,” the new Iranian letter to the United Nations read.

“In the course of the establishment of the new American system, history bears testimony to widespread genocides and deterritorialization as well as systematic social discrimination against the real owner of America. Those who were considered a kind of ‘others or aliens,’ included the native Americans, black Americans, and somehow the entire nonwhite community, who are the referents of the discriminated communities,” the letter said.

“Regretfully, the exceptionalist mentality of a small, but powerful and rich, American group is the source of widespread oppressions, sanctions, and historical falsifications as well as trampling upon human rights and evaluation of human values based on wealth, ethnicity, geographical situation, and religion,” it continued.

The signatories called on U.S. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet to create a “Committee for Investigating the Widespread Social Discrimination in the United States” and “insightfully utilize the global capacity to help end social discrimination and basically the racist mentality, particularly discrimination against black Americans.”

The Iranian regime made the same demands in June, couched in less academic verbiage. The Iranian Foreign Ministry called for an emergency meeting of the U.N. Human Rights Council to address the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis and said the human rights bureaucracy of the U.N. should be “geared toward confrontation of such phenomena as racism,” a phenomena Tehran insisted does not exist in Iran.

“What we are bearing witness to in U.S. society today is the upshot of systematic racism and injustice that has existed and continues to exist across the pillars and structures of the U.S. political establishment,” the Iranian Foreign Ministry said on that occasion.

Similar efforts were made by Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei in 2014 after the death of Eric Garner in New York. Khamenei even labeled his social media posts with #BlackLivesMatter.

The Lebanese Army statement warned that leakage of these additional chemicals could have “catastrophic” results. Army engineers previously discovered 20 containers of toxic material with potentially dangerous leaks that firefighters quickly secured.

Other regional port authorities are understandably apprehensive about the danger of a Beirut-style blast. Mustafa Sanallah, chairman of Libya’s National Oil Corporation, warned last week that several of Libya’s ports are at risk of explosions from dangerous chemicals, in this case ammonia gas – a risk that is especially acute with hot weather and ongoing factional fighting that involves plenty of explosives ordnance. Sanallah worried that Libya’s ports of Brega, Ras Lanuf, and Sidra have much larger stockpiles of potentially explosive material than the Port of Beirut did.

The Washington Post found nervous officials eyeing their own risky stockpiles of combustible chemicals at ports in Senegal, Egypt, India, and Romania.

Romanian officials decided to crack down on improperly stored ammonium nitrate and found nine thousand tons of it scattered around the country, about four times the amount that blew up half of Beirut. Dismayed Senegalese port officials realized they were stuck with an uncomfortable amount of ammonium nitrate because their Dakar port provides the main shipping route to Mali, a country whose borders have been closed due to political upheaval.

As for Lebanon, the political situation appears all too stable. The UK Guardian observed on Tuesday that despite widespread anticipation of political reform after hundreds of people were killed and injured by the ultimate wake-up call, Lebanon’s ruling class appears to remain firmly in power, each faction unwilling to surrender any power or shoulder the blame for the Beirut blast.",Lebanese Military Discovers More Dangerous Chemicals at Beirut Port,fake

State Department spokesperson Morgan Ortagus said Hamas chief Ismail Haniyeh and deputy chief Saleh al-Arouri are designated by the U.S. and European Union as “Specially Designated Global Terrorists.”

Al-Arouri, who has a $5 million bounty on his head from U.S. authorities, is wanted for his ties to several terror attacks, kidnappings and hijackings, including the 2014 kidnapping and murder of three Israeli teenagers — one with U.S. citizenship — in the West Bank, which he praised as a “heroic operation.” Ortagus said in a statement:

President Erdoğan’s continued outreach to this terrorist organization only serves to isolate Turkey from the international community, harms the interests of the Palestinian people, and undercuts global efforts to prevent terrorist attacks launched from Gaza. We continue to raise our concerns about the Turkish government’s relationship with Hamas at the highest levels. This is the second time President Erdogan has welcomed Hamas leadership to Turkey this year with the first meeting occurring February 1.

The response came as Secretary of State Mike Pompeo left Jerusalem for Khartoum in Sudan for the second leg of his Middle East tour.

The condemnation marks a departure from U.S. policy, which for years has ignored Ankara’s ongoing support for the terrorist group.

According to The Jerusalem Post, this is because the U.S. has traditionally sought closer ties with Turkey as “part of wishful thinking that [it] would turn away from Iran and Russia and work with the US on regional issues.”

Iraqi Finance Minister Ali Allawi revealed the energy plan in an online interview with the Atlantic Council, a Washington-based international affairs think tank, on August 21.

“This … has been going on for several years now, it is unlikely we can find a short term substitute, but a medium-term effort can be done by linking the Iraqi grid to the Gulf grid,” Allawi said. “The dependence on Iranian electricity and energy will begin to trail down significantly sometime next year.”

Allawi accompanied Iraqi Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi on his trip to Washington, D.C. last week. The diplomatic visit was part of a “U.S.-Iraq strategic dialogue … focused on security, economic, and energy cooperation between the two countries,” Iraqi Kurdish news agency Rudaw reported.

Kadhimi met with U.S. President Donald Trump at the White House on August 20 and the two discussed expanding economic ties between Iraq and the U.S. and signed “a series of oil and energy agreements to develop Iraq’s energy sector,” according to Rudaw.

On August 19, Iraqi Foreign Minister Fuad Hussein told reporters in Washington that Iraq expected to sign a deal that day with U.S. oil company Chevron to develop one of Iraq’s major oil fields.

“Regarding the signing of a memorandum of understanding or an agreement with Chevron, I believe that it will be signed today, yes,” Hussein said at a joint press conference with U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.

Allawi seemed to confirm Chevron’s oil deal with Iraq in his August 21 interview, saying that among the energy agreements signed by the U.S. and Iraq last week was a deal with Chevron to “develop the Iraqi oil and gas sector.”

In addition to the U.S., “Saudi Arabia is to invest in the Iraqi energy and gas sector, including Saudi-owned companies Aramco and Aqua group,” Allawi told the Atlantic Council.

Iraq has long struggled with chronic power outages and electricity shortages.

“Rampant electricity shortages have in past years been a rallying call for protestors, most notably in the summer of 2018,” Rudaw noted. Summer temperatures rise to over 120 degrees Fahrenheit in Iraq, nearly 40 percent of which is technically considered a desert region.

“The War [in Iraq, 2003-2011], corruption, insecurity, and lack of investment have altogether contributed to a deteriorating grid, leaving Iraqis at times with as little as five hours of national electricity per day. Privately owned generators set up in neighborhoods try to supplement the lost hours, making Iraqis pay twice for electricity,” Rudaw reported.

Grappling with a failing grid and an energy shortage, Iraq has been importing electricity and natural gas from neighboring Iran in recent years to fuel its generating stations.

“Iran exports 1200-1500 megawatts of electricity to Iraq on a daily basis, in addition to 38 million cubic meters of natural gas to feed several of Iraq’s power stations, according to Sayyid Hamid Hosseini, secretary-general of Iran-Iraq Joint Chamber of Commerce. In June, Baghdad and Tehran signed a two-year contract to continue the imports,” the report stated.

The U.S. has imposed economic sanctions on Iran for its nuclear proliferation and support for terrorism, including the Lebanon-based terror group Hezbollah. So far, the U.S. has allowed Iraq to import energy from Iran based on a temporary waiver program it hopes to phase out.

“The current waiver, Iraq’s ninth, issued in May, gives the country 120 days to continue its energy imports without financial penalties for the trade that has otherwise been banned by the U.S., after Washington withdrew from the 2015 nuclear deal and began reimposing sanctions on Iran in November 2018,” Rudaw reported on August 23.",Iraq Says It Will ‘Significantly’ Cut Gas Imports from Iran Next Year,fake

Heiko Maas’s visit comes as Greece begins a military exercise involving its navy and air force in the Mediterranean southeast of Crete and south of the Greek island of Kastellorizo, near an area where Turkey has sent research vessel Oruc Reis, accompanied by warships, to survey the seabed for gas and oil deposits.

In response to the Oruc Reis’s operations, Greece put its armed forces on alert and sent warships to shadow the Turkish vessels.

Turkey’s Defense Ministry said Turkish and allied navy ships would be conducting “maritime training” in the eastern Mediterranean on Tuesday “to promote coordination and interoperability.” A Turkish official said the training would last for a few hours only. It wasn’t immediately clear which countries were participating. Turkish media reported the exercise would be conducted south of the Greek island of Crete.

“Turkey and Greece are our NATO allies. There can only be solutions for the disputed questions surrounding the gas deposits in the eastern Mediterranean on the basis of international law and in sincere dialogue,” Maas said before his visit to the two countries.

“The tensions are not just weighing on the relationship between the EU and Turkey. A further escalation can only damage all sides, but above all those immediately involved on the spot.”

Greece says the area in which the Oruc Reis has been operating overlaps its own continental shelf and has demanded Turkey withdraw the ship. Ankara responded by extending its notification to shipping, known as a Navtex, about the research vessel’s operations to Aug. 27.

Athens retorted by declaring it will carry out a three-day military exercise in the area. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan warned that “as of now, Greece will be the only one responsible for any negative development in the region,” and said the military exercise “endangers the coastal and navigational safety of all ships in the region.”

The escalating tension has raised concerns of potential conflict between the two regional rivals, which have come to the brink of war three times since the mid-1970s, including once over prospecting rights in the Aegean Sea.

Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis has warned of the danger of an accident when so many military vessels are concentrated in a small area at sea. Earlier this month, Athens said a Greek frigate and a Turkish frigate collided while shadowing the Oruc Reis. No injuries were reported on either side. Greek media reported the Turkish frigate had suffered minor damage above the waterline.

“The windows for dialogue between Greece and Turkey must now be opened further and not closed,” Maas said. “For this, instead of new provocations, we finally need steps toward de-escalation and a start to direct talks.”

Maas’ trip comes ahead of a meeting of EU foreign ministers in Berlin later this week, at which Turkey will be discussed. Maas noted that “Greece’s voice will have particular weight.”","German FM Heads to Mediterranean as Peacemaker as Greece, Turkey Face Off",fake

Israel has bombed the Hamas-ruled enclave almost daily since August 6, in response to the airborne incendiary devices and, less frequently, rockets launched across the border.

“Fighter jets, tanks and aircraft struck military posts and an underground infrastructure belonging to the Hamas terror organisation in the southern Gaza Strip,” the army said.

The flare-up comes after US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo visited Israel on Monday and as British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab was due to hold talks in both Israel and the Palestinian Territories on Tuesday.

The fire balloons — makeshift incendiary devices fitted to inflated balloons, condoms or plastic bags — have sparked multiple blazes on farmland in southern Israel, causing significant damage to crops.

They are widely seen as an attempt by Hamas to improve the terms of an informal truce under which Israel committed to ease its 13-year-old blockade in return for calm on the border.

But so far Israel’s response has been to tighten the blockade. It has banned Gaza fishermen from going to sea and closed its goods crossing with the territory, prompting the closure of Gaza’s sole power plant for want of fuel.

An Egyptian delegation has been shuttling between the two sides to try to broker a renewal of the truce, so far without result.

Egypt has acted to calm repeated flare-ups in recent years to prevent any repetition of the three wars Israel and Hamas have fought since 2008.

The latest ceasefire, which has already been renewed several times, is bolstered by millions of dollars in financial aid from Qatar to Gaza.

The truce provided for permits for Gazans to work in Israel and financing for Gaza development projects, both measures that would provide some economic relief in an impoverished territory where unemployment exceeds 50 percent.

According to a source close to Hamas, the movement wants the extension of an industrial zone in the east of Gaza, and the construction of a new power line.

Hamas also wants the number of Israeli work permits issued to Gazans to be doubled to 10,000 once anti-coronavirus restrictions are lifted, the source said.

“I hope one day that the Iranians will normalize with Israel as well,” Pompeo told The Jerusalem Post while on a brief visit to the country.

“I have every expectation that the world will come to see Israel as the rightful Jewish homeland, and that it is going to be here. So, I leave no country out from my commitment to my core belief that one day the world will recognize that this is the right thing to do for their country – and I would include Iran in that as well.”

Pompeo’s visit to Jerusalem marked the beginning of a five-day tour in the region, with stops in Sudan, Bahrain, and Abu Dhabi. According to U.S. officials, he may also stop in Oman and Qatar.

Pompeo met with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Defense Minister Benny Gantz and Foreign Minister Gabi Ashkenazi to discuss the UAE deal and possible normalization accords with other Arab nations. He told the Post:

I couldn’t tell you the timing and I couldn’t tell you which countries, but I think as other nations around the world come to see that there is enormous benefit to the relationship – from a diplomatic perspective, an economic perspective, and from a security perspective – I think that other nations will see that it is the right thing to do. I think they will also come to see that building out this set of relationships is the pathway that will lead to stability in the Middle East as well.

In return for the diplomatic ties with the UAE, the U.S. requested Netanyahu suspend his plans to apply sovereignty over parts of the West Bank.

Pompeo told the Post the length of Israel’s commitment not to annex would have “better clarity” when Netanyahu and Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Zayed met with President Donald Trump to sign the treaty in the coming weeks.

“I’ll leave it to those three leaders to discuss,” he said. “The commitment that the Israelis made was that they would not extend their sovereignty for a period of time. We are hopeful that the leaders will all be physically together, and will probably have greater clarity and the ability to answer that more clearly.”

Pompeo would not answer directly whether he believed Saudi Arabia would eventually normalize ties with Israel.

“I think the world turns that way. So it is not worth making any prediction. But I think that as time goes on, there is a clarity that this Jewish nation and these nations that are Arab states, will find that acknowledging that Israel does exist and shall exist is something that they will find their way to as well,” he said.

During a joint press briefing on Monday with Netanyahu, Pompeo said that while the U.S. would remain committed to preserving Israel’s qualitative military edge in the region, it may provide the United Arab Emirates with weapons at a future date.

The UAE, among the world’s biggest defense spenders, has voiced its desire to purchase F-35 fighter jets but a pledge made by the U.S. after the 1973 Yom Kippur War to preserve Israel’s “qualitative military edge” in the region has prevented it from doing so until now.

“The US has, and I am confident always will, remain committed to Israel’s security and the issues of QME remain statutory and are a legal requirement in the US,” he told the Post, adding the U.S. has also sold advanced weapon systems to the UAE for more than 20 years “to help keep them safe and secure.”

“We have an obligation to try and do our best to make sure they [the UAE Y.K.] have the weapon systems that they need,” he continued. “They face a real threat just like Israel does from the Islamic Republic of Iran. We have sold them Patriot missiles and we have sold them other equipment. The fact that they have now recognized Israel, gives us another chance to go reevaluate and see what’s appropriate, how do we do that and we are committed to doing that and we will.”

He added the benefits of the UAE deal included intelligence sharing as well as a mechanism for seeing President Donald Trump’s peace proposal to fruition.

“There’s lots of pieces to this that we now will have the opportunity in ways that we couldn’t before but we are committed to maintaining [Israel’s] security,” he said.

“None of it precludes the Palestinians observing that the Israelis are prepared to have this conversation, are prepared to negotiate and that our vision for peace provides a reasonable basis on which to begin that set of conversations,” he said. “It’s no longer the case that the Palestinians are going to be able to exercise a veto on the rationalization of the relationship and the normalization of the relationship between Israel and other countries.”",Mike Pompeo: I Hope Iran Will Normalize Ties with Israel,fake

Al-Arouri has been linked to several terrorist attacks against Israelis, including the 2014 kidnapping and murder of three Israeli teenagers in the West Bank, which he praised as a “heroic operation.”

The meeting also included Hamas’ overseas leader Maher Salah, Hamas head of Arab and Islamic religions, Ezzat al-Rihiq, and Hamas representative in Turkey, Jihad Yaghmor.

The delegation met with the Turkish prime minister to discuss the U.S.-brokered normalization agreement between Israel and the United Arab Emirates, which both sides deeply oppose.

Hamas and Turkey’s ruling party have roots in the Muslim Brotherhood. Erdogan in the past has panned the U.S. for “working with terrorists” in Syria, over U.S. support for Kurdish fighters combating ISIS.

Hamas head Ismael Haniyeh “congratulated Erdogan on the advent of a new Hijri year, discovery of a new natural-gas field and the reopening of the Aya Sofia Mosque,” according to a statement released by the terror group.

The Aya Sofia Mosque was one of two ancient churches that Turkey turned into mosques recently, causing a storm of controversy.

Hamas also said it was working against Israel’s “Judaization of Jerusalem.”

According to the UK’s Telegraph newspaper, Turkey has granted citizenship to senior operatives of a Hamas terrorist cell. The paper also reported that Hamas plotted terror attacks from Turkish soil.",Turkey’s Erdogan Hosts Hamas Delegation with Wanted Terrorist,fake

Haley, who had little foreign policy experience before heading to the U.N., won worldwide respect by standing up for U.S. interests — and won the hearts of pro-Israel Americans with her fervent defenses of the U.S. Israel alliance.

She spoke about the Obama-Biden administration’s poor record on Israel, the Middle East, and the United Nations itself:

Obama and Biden let Iran get away with murder and literally sent them a plane full of cash. President Trump did the right thing and ripped up the Iran nuclear deal. Obama and Biden led the United Nations to denounce our friend and ally, Israel. President Trump moved our embassy to Jerusalem – and when the U.N. tried to condemn us, I was proud to cast the American veto. This President has a record of strength and success. The former Vice President has a record of weakness and failure. Joe Biden is good for Iran and ISIS, great for Communist China, and he’s a godsend to everyone who wants America to apologize, abstain, and abandon our values.

The word “abstain” is a reference to the outgoing Obama administration’s decision to abstain from U.N. Security Council Resolution 2334, allowing it to pass. The resolution declared the Israeli presence in all areas across the 1949 armistice line — including the Old City of Jerusalem, where Jews have lived almost without interruption for millennia — to be illegal.

Biden in particular condemned Israel for planning to build apartments in a Jewish neighborhood of Jerusalem in 2010.

703,http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2020/08/24/report-ties-ship-carrying-explosive-material-causing-beirut-blast-hezbollah/,2020-08-24T00:00:00,breitbart,"The German newspaper Der Spiegel published a report this weekend claiming that the ship suspected of bringing 2,750 tons of ammonium nitrate to the Port of Beirut in 2013 had ties to a bank involved in laundering money for Hezbollah, the Iran-backed terrorist organization and Lebanese political party.

Authorities believed the ship in question, MV Rhosus, belonged to a Russian businessman named Igor Grechuskhin who declared bankruptcy not long after coast guard officials in Lebanon impounded the ship for mechanical violations and transferred its dangerous cargo of chemical fertilizer to a warehouse, where it remained until it exploded in early August, killing over 120 people and damaging half the city.

Der Spiegel, in cooperation with the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP), argued the true owner of the Rhosus was not Grechuskhin but a Cypriot businessman named Charalambos Manoli.

Manoli appears to have taken some pains to conceal ownership, but he admitted to OCCRP that while Grechuskhin offered to buy the Rhosus from him, the deal never actually went through. In Der Spiegel’s telling, Grechushkin chartered the ship for the ill-fated shipment of ammonium nitrate and managed the voyage, but Manoli owned the vessel all along.

Der Spiegel’s report further challenged the narrative that the Rhosus was on its way from Russian Georgia to Mozambique when it failed a port inspection in Beirut and got stuck there, its cargo seized after Grechushkin failed to pay its bills. Instead, the investigative report suggested many details of the Rhosus’ voyage were staged or fabricated and its true purpose was to deliver the highly explosive ammonium nitrate to Hezbollah.

A key piece of evidence presented by Der Spiegel to tie Manoli to Hezbollah is that unlike Grechuskhin, the Cypriot businessman has business ties in Lebanon, and in 2011 he took out a $4 million loan to buy another ship from a bank based in Tanzania called FBME.

“FBME isn’t just any bank. American investigators have accused the institution of acting as a money launderer for Hezbollah. Another of the bank’s customers was a suspected Syrian front company that had been involved in the country’s chemical weapons program. It was to this bank that Manoli owed money,” the article said.

“Internal FBME documents show that Manoli still owed the bank 962,000 euros in outstanding debt in October 2014. Manoli denies any connection between his debts and the fact that the freighter was stopped in Beirut. However, one investigator notes that FBME is notorious for pressuring defaulting borrowers into doing favors for dubious customers like Hezbollah,” Der Spiegel added.

FBME issued a statement for publication denying any untoward activity and denying that it sought to use the Rhosus as collateral for another loan, although it confirmed that it has done business with Manoli and his company, SeaForce Marine Ltd.:

Neither FBME, the Saab family, nor their associates had any involvement with the MV Rhosus. FBME Bank did provide, in around 2012, a loan to SeaForce Marine Ltd, owned by Mr. Charalambos Manoli, for the purchase of the MV Sakhalin. This loan was accordingly secured against the MV Sakhalin, which has since been scrapped. Neither Mr Manoli nor SeaForce Marine Ltd made any repayments towards the loan, and the Bank initiated legal proceedings against them. Since the Administrators took over the Bank in July 2014, we are unaware of the current status of the case. The MV Rhosus was never collateral for the loan and FBME Bank never had any involvement either with its financing or ownership. We believe these allegations are commercially motivated and confirm that we have no relationship with Hezbollah. [Updated with statement reprinted in full.]

Two other suspicious details unearthed by Der Spiegel are that the purported buyer of the ammonium nitrate in Mozambique, a company called FEM, has been investigated for ties to Islamic terrorism, and that no one has actually stepped forward to claim ownership of the ammonium nitrate cargo — Lebanese officials never even formally confiscated it. Roughly $700,000 worth of dangerous chemicals supposedly sat in a warehouse for six years, as forgotten as the Rhosus, said to have succumbed to its many leaks and sank outside the Port of Beirut in 2018, claimed by neither Grechushkin nor Manoli.

Some customs officials in Beirut did care about the abandoned cargo, and they very much wanted to get rid of it, but Der Spiegel reported that petitions to remove the chemicals were “sent to the wrong court so persistently that it is difficult for lawyers involved to believe in mere incompetence.”

The implication is that Hezbollah wanted the substance to remain at the port so they could use it for bomb-making. As Der Spiegel and OCCRP investigators noted, there is no way to be certain all 2,750 tons of ammonium nitrate were present and accounted for when the explosion struck; some of it could have been siphoned away for nefarious purposes over the years. The last time the abandoned cargo was inspected in the spring of 2020, the inspectors noticed “one of the warehouse’s gates was missing and there was a large hole in the south wall,” but apparently no one checked to see if any of the ammonium nitrate was missing.

Furthermore, European intelligence officials have estimated the stupendous explosion that horrified the world was not big enough to represent 2,750 tons of ammonium nitrate blowing up. The Beirut blast appeared to involve 700 to 1,000 tons, meaning more than half of the Rhosus cargo is unaccounted for.

AFP found Hezbollah in a precarious position in Lebanese politics, with public anger growing so intense after the Beirut blast that formerly untouchable leader Hassan Nasrallah has been mocked and hanged in effigy.

“A widely shared meme had a screen grab of Nasrallah choking back tears over the killing of Iranian spymaster Qasem Soleimani in a US drone strike in Iraq earlier this year, contrasting with another of him looking composed and smiling after the Beirut blast,” AFP reported, referring to Nasrallah’s emotional response when a U.S. strike killed Iranian terror mastermind Gen. Qassem Soleimani on Iraqi soil in January.

The Times of Israel (TOI) cited another report from last week that Iran provided Hezbollah with about 670 tons of ammonium nitrate in 2013. This report speculated the Rhosus cargo might not have been directly ordered or held by the terrorist organization, but instead Hezbollah loyalists working at the port might have hoarded it because they thought Hezbollah would be interested in it.

“A Channel 13 report earlier this month claimed Hezbollah planned to use the ammonium nitrate stockpile that caused the blast at Beirut’s port against Israel in a ‘Third Lebanon War’ that may come in the future. It did not cite sources,” TOI added.",Report Ties Ship Carrying Explosives Causing Beirut Blast to Hezbollah,fake

Ayanna Pressley (D-MA) Thursday evening.

Clinton said, “You know, 40% of Americans with disabilities report that they have real challenges voting in person.

She continued, “And I think it’s really important that my children understand that. And I think it’s particularly important that they understand that as white children of privilege because I want them to erode that privilege throughout their lives to ensure more people are enfranchised and that equality isn’t just an ideal.”

Pressley said, “You’re really modeling that which my mother certainly believed, which is that a parent is a child’s first teacher. And I so appreciate that you’re providing that full education, because we know that often there is a revisionist history or a sanitizing or filtering of history that does not tell the whole story.”

“Seattle #antifa group @riotkitchen206 was arrested in Kenosha, Wisc. They drove all the way there with their van & stopped to fill multiple fuel cans with gasoline in what is believed for criminal purposes,” Ngo said, detailing the arrests.

“It’s an antifa group that supplies rioters. They claim to only give out food but as authorities in Kenosha found, they bring with them much more than that,” he added:

On August 26, Kenosha Police received reports of “several suspicious vehicles with out of state plates” meeting in a remote lot. Officers identified the suspicious vehicles as a black school bus, bread truck, and minivan, and surveilled them, witnessing individuals attempting to fill multiple fuel cans.

Authorities suspected that the individuals were “preparing for criminal activity related to the civil unrest” in the city, prompting their response.

According to the Kenosha Police’s media release, individuals in the minivan attempted to escape, but police stopped the vehicle and “ultimately forced entry to the minivan and arrested the occupants.” Those in the bus and bread truck were also arrested, with nine total arrests for disorderly conduct. Authorities recovered several items of interest from the vehicles, including “helmets, gas masks, protective vests, illegal fireworks, and suspected controlled substances.”

The Seattle Times identified those arrested as members of the Seattle-based Riot Kitchen, which presents itself as a group of volunteers who provide support to protesters, as Ngo acknowledged.

“FEED THE PEOPLE. Providing hot food including vegetarian/vegan for Seattle folx, the group’s Twitter bio reads alongside the hashtags #blacklivesmatter, #icantbreathe, and #sayhisname.

Riot Kitchen also posted a video of the arrest, accusing authorities of kidnapping their volunteers.

“Riot Kitchen HQ just learned that our bus crew was arrested in broad daylight in #Kenosha today – kidnapped by feds in unmarked vans. We are currently trying to find our friends who were just there to feed people,” the group said, failing to address why its volunteers also had illegal fireworks, suspected controlled substances, helmets, haz masks, and protective vests in their possession:

According to the Times, Riot Kitchen came as the result of the prolonged protests in Seattle, serving the former “autonomous” zone known as the Capitol Hill Organized Protest (CHOP) — an area dominated by self-described anarchists and Antifa activists.

The Times reported that Riot Kitchen recently “expanded its efforts to provide food at Portland protests and this month incorporated as a nonprofit.”

“We are a nonprofit and our mission is to feed people for free — protesters and everyone in need,” board member Jennifer Scheurle claimed. “We were from out of town — but that’s not illegal.”

The group’s presence came as violence continued to escalate in Kenosha, with protesters shamelessly torching businesses throughout the city. Gov. Tony Evers (D) has since requested additional states to assist Wisconsin as local authorities gear up for what could be a weekend of violence in Kenosha.

“National Guard troops from Arizona, Michigan, and Alabama will add to Wisconsin National Guard troops already on the ground supporting civil authorities in Kenosha under the EMAC,” a Thursday press release from the governor’s office read.","Andy Ngo Calls 'Riot Kitchen,' Arrested in Kenosha, an 'Antifa Group'",fake

Rowling returned a 2019 award to the Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights foundation after the group’s president denounced her defense of women’s rights in the transgender debate.

The foundation “has stated that there is no conflict between the current radical trans rights movement and the rights of women,” Rowling said, adding, “The thousands of women who’ve got in touch with me disagree, and, like me, believe this clash of rights can only be resolved if more nuance is permitted in the debate.”

Rowling said she wants to protect young people from being pressured by transgender activists into life-changing decisions:

Clinicians, academics, therapists, teachers, social workers, and staff at prisons and women’s refuges have also contacted me. These professionals, some at the very top of their organisations, have expressed serious concerns about the impact of gender identity theory on vulnerable adolescents and on women’s rights, and of the dismantling of safeguarding norms which protect the most vulnerable women.

… I’ve been particularly struck by the stories of brave detransitioned young women who’ve risked the opprobrium of activists by speaking up about a movement they say has harmed them. After hearing personally from some of these women, and from such a wide range of professionals, I’ve been forced to the unhappy conclusion that an ethical and medical scandal is brewing. I believe the time is coming when those organisations and individuals who have uncritically embraced fashionable dogma, and demonised those urging caution, will have to answer for the harm they’ve enabled.

Kerry Kennedy, the president of the foundation, had denounced Rowling on August 3 for her refusal to say that a person’s self-declared “gender” is more important than their biological sex:

From her own words, I take Rowling’s position to be that the sex one is assigned at birth is the primary and determinative factor of one’s gender, regardless of one’s gender identity—a position that I categorically reject. The science is clear and conclusive: Sex is not binary.

Rowling “has chosen to use her remarkable gifts to create a narrative that diminishes the identity of trans and nonbinary people, undermining the validity and integrity of the entire transgender community,” said Kennedy, who is Robert F. Kennedy’s daughter. Robert Kennedy was the brother of President John F. Kennedy and served as his Attorney General.

Kerry is also related to Rep. Joe Kennedy III (D-MA), who heads the transgender caucus in the House of Representatives.

“As Chair of the Congressional LGBT Caucus’s Transgender Equality Task Force, Kennedy is a leader in Washington for LGBTQIA+ rights,” Joe Kennedy’s website reads. “He is a proud supporter of the Equality Act and introduced legislation to ban the so-called ‘Gay and Trans Panic’ defense, as well as a resolution recognizing a national Transgender Day of Remembrance.”

Rowling dismissed Kerry Kennedy’s claim that she is ignoring the concerns of people who feel uncomfortable in their body’s sex, saying:

Like the vast majority of the people who’ve written to me, I feel nothing but sympathy towards those with gender dysphoria, and agree with the clinicians and therapists who’ve got in touch who want to see a proper exploration of the factors that lead to it.

Many feminists and conservatives have cheered Rowling since she began to speak out against the transgender ideology.

Video shows a massive group of people in attendance at Friday’s event at the Lincoln Memorial, on the 57th anniversary of the historic 1963 March on Washington. According to the NAACP, Friday’s march aims to “recommit to the dream Dr. Martin Luther King defined in the 1963 march, to call for police accountability and reform, and to mobilize voters ahead of the November elections.”

While left-wing groups have been overtly critical of President Donald Trump for holding in-person events — from the Mount Rushmore Independence Day celebration to Thursday night’s Republican National Convention speech — footage from Friday’s event shows virtually no demonstrative attempts to socially distance, despite organizers promising to heed to health guidance and local coronavirus-related restrictions.

In a piece previewing the protest, CNN reported that event organizers “have stressed that the march will comply with health guidance and local ordinances related to the coronavirus pandemic.”

“We can have a protest, share our voice in this moment, and still be safe,” Tylik McMillan, the national director of youth and college for NAN, told CNN, explaining that volunteers will be “highly enforcing” social distancing.

“On the monument grounds, attendees will be in ‘grids,’ sections to enforce social distancing, that will be limited,” CNN reported.

“We want to ensure that we’re taking all necessary precautions to protect people,” McMillan said.

CNN added that hand sanitizer and masks would be provided to participants of the march and reported that NAN encouraged those from coronavirus “hotspots,” such as Florida and Texas, to participate in the march virtually.

The event follows the final night of the Republican National Convention, where Trump delivered his acceptance speech from the White House. The set up drew ire from critics, as seats were not spread apart. Prominent members of the media expressed shock over the lack of masks in the audience, despite some of their own forgoing face coverings as well:

The panel was discussing 17-year-old Kyle Rittenhouse being arrested after two people were shot to death during the third night of protests in Kenosha.

Pavlich said, “You are making a choice as a leader not to stop riots at the beginning. There are resources to help you do that. The Wisconsin governor rejected, according to the White House chief of staff, additional resources and National Guard before the most horrific night we’ve seen this week in Kenosha. This is a choice that they are making not to stop the violence initially.”

She continued, “I have to say on the argument of vigilante justice when you have no police around to defend businesses and people who are being attacked, and their livelihoods burned to the ground, then there is a void that is filled. You have to ask yourself when resources are offered at the beginning of when these riots break out and rejected by Democratic leaders over and over again. You have to ask the question, why?”

She added, “This is a pattern of behavior, not just now. You’ll remember, in Baltimore a couple of years ago, when the mayor said she gave the “protesters room to destroy,” and they completely went through the city and ruined everything, This is a pattern of behavior which Democratic leaders are not capable of defending their cities and the people who live within them.”

Following a commercial break, Wallace said, “I’ve got to push back on something we said at the end of the last segment because there seemed to be the implication that somehow vigilante justice was understandable or justified by the lack of sufficient police action and authority and presence in some of these cities.”

He continued, “Just as it is fair to say that rioting and looting is a completely inappropriate response to George Floyd or Jacob Blake, vigilante justice is a completely inappropriate response to the rioting in the street. There is no justification for what happened in Kenosha, and vigilante justice is a crime and should be punished as a crime.”

Host Harris Faulkner interjected, “We did not say that, and now we have said it. We did not say that before.”

Wallace shot back, “You were saying ‘fill a void’ and I don’t think that’s right.”

Faulkner said, “The one thing that Melissa said is nobody is saying that the right thing to do. But to actually point out that it is, in fact, a crime is the nuance of what Chris Wallace is saying. I feel like we’ve had a complete conversation on that.”

The man then walks away to receive treatment after being sprayed in the face with mace.

The woman wearing the MAGA hat was not injured.

The incident took place outside Gresham City Hall, as Back the Blue demonstrators held an event that responded to the Black Lives Matter flag flown outside the municipal building, Newsweek reported.

Gresham’s neighboring city of Portland has held countless protests that have devolved into riots ever since Minneapolis man George Floyd was killed.

“When we want to peacefully protest and say what we want to say, we always have BLM follow us,” Shelby Walman, part of the Back the Blue group, told KATU.

The Gresham City Council held a meeting Wednesday to discuss the possibility of removing the Black Lives Matter flag, which was scheduled to be up until the end of the month, over safety concerns because of the protests.

“The Black Lives Matter flag will continue to be flown, per Council’s original direction, through August 31. However, the work of continuing to foster equity and inclusion within Gresham will continue, as City Council is committed to furthering racial justice within our community,” the city said.

997,http://www.breitbart.com/2020-election/2020/08/27/pinkerton-riot-reality-is-biting-the-democrats/,2020-08-27T00:00:00,breitbart,"On August 26, District of Columbia Mayor Muriel Bowser condemned the protesters seen heckling diners at various D.C. restaurants.

Videos of the obnoxious moments, including one from the Washington Post, went viral, leading Bowser, a Democrat, to declare:

What I saw in those videos was highly inappropriate, it was likely against the law if they were on private property but more importantly, I don’t think it had anything to do with demands for social justice.

Bowser’s comments inspired C.C. Pecknold, a professor at the Catholic University of America, to tweet slyly, “The internal polling must be really bad.” Pecknold was referring, of course, to the growing realization, reinforced by survey data, that the Democrats’ soft-on-rioters stance is starting to erode their chances in the November balloting. In fact, already on August 13, the Pew Center found that 59 percent of Americans said that crime was a “very important” issue in 2020.

Since then, of course, the crime situation has worsened, as Kenosha has gone up in flames, while Democrat politicians have done little, or even, seemingly, encouraged the rioters—here’s looking at you, Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers. Moreover, it’s becoming clear that this lenience toward crime could hurt the entire Democrat ticket.

Indeed, even Democrats’ best friends in the Main Stream Media are starting to get, and share, that message of concern. As CNN anchor Don Lemon told Chris Cuomo on August 25, “Kenosha is a Rorschach test for the entire country. I think this is a blind spot for Democrats. I think Democrats are hoping this will go away, and it’s not going to go away.”

The CNN man’s words of warning might lead one to conclude that Lemon, as well as Bowser, has seen warning-flag survey numbers. In fact, that’s exactly what Lemon said: “I know it’s showing up in the polling, it’s showing up in focus groups. It is the only thing right now that is sticking.”

Interestingly, Lemon didn’t always worry about rioting. Just three months ago, Breitbart News reported that he described the riots as a “mechanism” for the needed “restructuring” of the country. As he said on May 30, “Perhaps this is some sort of mechanism for a restructure in our country or some sort of change in our country for us to deal with whatever we need to deal with in this country as we look at pictures on the right of burning and pictures on the left of looting.”

Yet now, it seems that too many pictures of burning and looting have taken their toll on the Democrats’ standing. An August 26 poll from Milwaukee’s Marquette University found support for Black Lives Matter in the Badger State to be tumbling. These findings led liberal journalist Jonathan Chait to observe, “Democrats need to be extremely concerned about what’s happening in Wisconsin, where support for BLM has gone from +25 to +0 in 2 months.”

In the meantime, Meghan McCain, definitely not a Trump fan, tweeted Lemon’s September 25 comments and added her own assessment:

Everything @donlemon said here is accurate. This is the one issue that could really turn the election against Biden and is showing up in the polling – all leaders have to come out forcefully and unequivocally against violence and looting.

And journalist Matt Lewis, another non-fan of Trump, sighed, “This is how Trump wins.”

Indeed, Republicans, sensing the political opportunity, are piling on. In his Wednesday night speech to the Republican convention, Vice President Mike Pence was firm as he added yet another city to the list of Democrat urban war zones: “Let me be clear: The violence must stop, whether in Minneapolis, Portland, or Kenosha . . . We will have law and order on the streets of this country for every American of every race and creed and color.”

Then Pence zeroed in on the nation’s top Democrat: “Joe Biden says America is ‘systemically racist,’ and that law enforcement in America has a quote ‘implicit bias’ against minorities.” Continuing, Pence added, “The hard truth is, you won’t be safe in Joe Biden’s America.” By contrast, “Under President Trump, we will stand with those who stand on the Thin Blue Line.” And Pence’s words were bolstered by others speaking at the convention, including Donald Trump Jr., Rep. Jim Jordan, and Rep. Dan Crenshaw.

In the face of this Republican onslaught, the MSM is realizing that its familiar mantra, that these are just “peaceful protestors”—with, okay, just a little bit of arson and violence—is wearing thin.

Thus the new MSM mantra is to warn the Democrats; hence this warning-siren headline in the New York Times: “How Chaos in Kenosha is Already Swaying Some Voters.” As the Times put it, “As residents see fires and looting, some worry that local Democratic leaders are failing to keep control of the situation.” We can pause to observe that the newspaper is putting the onus on local, as opposed to national Democrats. It seems that Wisconsin’s Democrat governor might be expendable, but not, of course, the Democrat presidential nominee.

In fact, that same day, August 27, Politico went further, connecting the burning of Main Street to the incineration of Democrats’ hopes for 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue; the headline on its piece bannered, “It’s playing into Trump’s hands’: Dems fear swing-state damage from Kenosha unrest.” The article, datelined from the embattled Wisconsin city, detailed, “As this battleground state grapples with social unrest, some Democrats fear that the looting and rioting and clashes are feeding Trump’s argument that this is what life would be like under the so-called radical left.”

So we can see: Reasons for Democrats to afraid, very afraid, are mounting. As CNN’s Lemon said on the 25th, referring to Biden’s quiet position vis-a-vis the rioters, “He’s got to address it.” Yet then Lemon added something revealing: He suggested that the former vice president might not, in fact, be willing to address the riots in a meaningful way: “I think maybe Joe Biden may be afraid to do it. I’m not sure.”

Indeed, Biden has been hesitant to say much of anything except, maybe, to blame the police. On August 24, he posted on Facebook declaring, “This morning, the nation wakes up yet again with grief and outrage that yet another Black American is a victim of excessive force. This calls for an immediate, full and transparent investigation and the officers must be held accountable.” Here we can see the Gov. Tony Evers-ish presumption that the police are the bad guys, that they used “excessive force.” Then Biden added this hat-tip to the far left: “We must dismantle systemic racism. It is the urgent task before us.”

Such words will reassure the left wing of the Democrat Party, which has regarded Biden as too “moderate.” And yet Team Biden is now being warned that it can’t win with just the left, and that rhetoric that puts the burden, even the outright blame, on the cops isn’t going to help his cause.

Indeed, in the midst of this fiery new crime wave, the betting odds on the election, while still favoring Biden to win, have narrowed sharply, from a margin of +24 on August 5 to just +8 on August 27.

Seeming to sense his vulnerability, on August 28 Biden gave his riot-messaging another try, adding a video statement on Facebook in which he said, “Needless violence won’t heal us. We need to end the violence—and peacefully come together to demand justice.” Those words can be read as a gentle reproach to the rioters in Wisconsin, and maybe even the shouters and screamers in D.C., although, of course, it doesn’t mention either by name. Biden just can’t seem to bring himself to condemn the rioters.

If we were inclined to, we could sympathize with Biden. He’s the man atop an increasingly left-wing party, trying to win a national election in a centrist country that worries, more and more, about crime and unrest. And so Biden is, well, tongue-tied, because whatever he says on the subject will antagonize some group of listeners.

So that’s why Biden seems happy saying as little as possible about the rioting. Indeed, he seems happy not saying much of anything.

That yearning for the sound of silence might explain why House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a close Biden ally, suggested on the 27th that Biden not debate President Trump, which would undo a presidential campaign tradition going back to 1976. For his part, Biden has said that he looks forward to debating Trump, and yet he has hinted at odd pre-conditions, such as demanding the onstage presence of a “fact-checker,” which suggest that maybe he’s not so eager, after all, to debate the incumbent president. So perhaps there’s some complicated maneuvering going on here, as Pelosi sends up trial balloons to see what might be politically feasible. In any case, in campaign terms, it’s a long time between now and the first scheduled presidential debate, on September 29.

So this seems to be the strategy from Team Biden: Say as little as possible, period. In fact, in quiet times, such quietude might have been a plausible plan for the Democrats; that is, if Biden is in the lead, let him sit on that lead, quietly, between now and November 3.

Yet these are tempestuous times; the plain reality is that the rioting requires a loud and robust response; Americans want to hear from both presidential candidates as to their plan to restore law and order. (Having, say, D.C.’s full-throated mayor, Muriel Bowser, substitute for Biden in the debates will not suffice, and probably not even Kamala Harris.)

The fact is, Joe Biden is going to have to speak for himself on the key issue of keeping the streets of America safe. And that’s a reality that threatens to really bite the Democrats over the next ten weeks.",Pinkerton: Riot Reality Is Biting the Democrats,fake

On Wednesday evening, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey (D) implemented a curfew, while Gov. Tim Walz (D) activated the Minnesota National Guard after rumors of a police-involved shooting of a black man sparked violence in the city’s downtown core.

The Pioneer Press reports:

Sixty-seven people were booked on probable cause felonies, according to a Minneapolis police spokesman. Police Chief Medaria Arradondo said a robust law enforcement presence will continue in the city tonight. “We cannot tolerate this any longer,” he said Thursday. People broke windows and began looting businesses in downtown Minneapolis after a homicide suspect shot himself as police closed in. There were false rumors that officers had shot the man, but police released surveillance video that showed he took his own life.

Videos of the looting, some shared by FOX 9 reporter Courtney Godfrey, show people stealing goods from liquor stores and other nearby businesses.

Godfrey wrote: “Looting in downtown Minneapolis. Haskell’s liquor store and Medical Arts building included. This is all linked to alleged suicide of suspect in earlier homicide. Crowds down here were convinced he was shot by police.”

But Lauren Victor, an urban planner who said she has supported and even taken part in protests, did not comply.

Victor told the Washington Post, “I felt like I was under attack.”

The Post reported that the mob was chanting, “No Justice, No Peace,” and, “Fire, fire, gentrifier — black people used to live here.”

The Daily Mail reported on the backlash BLM activists got for intimidating people who were trying to eat a meal:

Ironically, Victor is a supporter of the Black Lives Matter movement and has participated in many marches, but didn’t want to be ‘coerced’ into showing support. ‘In the moment, it didn’t feel right,’ she stated. ‘I wasn’t actually frightened. I didn’t think they’d do anything to me. I’m very much with them. I’ve been marching with them for weeks and weeks and weeks.’ She said she felt that it was wrong for hundreds of people to surround a small group of diners, approach them with their hands raised, and try to cow them into making a show of support.

The video of the incident shows the mob intimidating other diners, including young children, demanding they raise their fists to show solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement.

According to the Hospital de las Clínicas, seven patients are suspected of testing positive for the virus a second time and are undergoing further clinical examinations. The patients reportedly have shown relevant symptoms and tested positive in a diagnostic test in two separate periods.

“All the cases are still under investigation,” the clinic said in a statement.

Brazilian hospital authorities are currently examining several hypotheses in explaining the reinfection. The first theory is that it is a different virus that has confused researchers because of the presence of “inactive fragments” of the coronavirus still in their systems.

Another explanation is that the positive test could be a result of the reactivation of the coronavirus pathogen after a period of inactivity in the body. The other theory is that it is simply a second infection caused by the same virus.

The investigations come less than a month after a study from the same city suggested it is possible to contract the virus multiple times. The study, which was carried out at the University of Sāo Paulo, cited the case of a nursing technician whose symptoms returned, concluding that her case “presents strong evidence not only for reinfection, [but also] a recurrence of symptoms.”

On Monday, Hong Kong authorities confirmed the first documented case of reinfection of a 33-year-old man who was infected again following a trip to Spain and four months after testing positive for the first time. Both the Netherlands and Belgium on Tuesday reported the first two cases of coronavirus reinfection in Europe.

Brazil, which has an estimated population of around 210 million people, registered its first case of coronavirus on February 26 in Sao Paulo, which was also the first contagion reported in Latin America. As of Wednesday, the country has recorded close to 3.7 million cases and 116,964 deaths, the second-highest figure worldwide.

This works out at a mortality rate of around 556 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants, placing it well below other countries such as Peru, Belgium, and the United Kingdom. Among those infected was the country’s President Jair Bolsonaro, who repeatedly expressed his skepticism about lockdown measures and the virus’s severity. He has since made a full recovery.

Brazil currently has the second-highest official tally of coronavirus cases in the world, second to the United States, and standing at 3.7 million cases and 117,665 deaths at press time. These numbers do not reflect, however, the high likelihood of data from rogue states like China, Russia, and North Korea being incomplete and inaccurate. A study by the American Enterprise Institute estimated that China’s official coronavirus case count is likely millions of cases lower than the actual number of affected people.

Bolsonaro’s remark, followed by accusations that journalists engage in “evil” and “debauchery,” occurred one day after Brazilian establishment media widely condemned the president for telling a reporter, “I want to stuff your mouth with punches.” Bolsonaro was reacting to a question about a Brazilian magazine report revealing ties between his wife and a former aide arrested on charges of corruption.

Bolsonaro was speaking at an event addressing doctors handling Chinese coronavirus patients on Monday. Brazil has one of the largest documented numbers of cases in the world — second only to the United States, with the caveat that rogue regimes like China, Russia, and North Korea are likely not publishing accurate data. At press time, Brazil has documented about 3.6 million coronavirus cases and a little over 115,000 deaths. Bolsonaro has taken significant criticism for this because of his insistence on not locking down the nation’s economy, actively promoting business as usual in contrast to many other states.

Bolsonaro himself tested positive for Chinese coronavirus in July, enduring what he described as a mild case that appeared to last less than a month. Discussing his experience with the disease on Monday, Bolsonaro attributed his success in combating it to his past as an “athlete” and soldier.

“But that story is about an athlete, you know?” Bolsonaro told reporters of his case. “Someone in the press engages in debauchery, but when one of you fat-asses get it [coronavirus], the chances of survival are much lower.”

“They [the press] only know how to do evil, how to use a pen in large part malevolently,” he added, according to the national newspaper O Globo.

O Globo‘s reporter was the target of Bolsonaro’s attack on Sunday. While the newspaper did not name the reporter, it did identify itself as the outlet responsible for asking Bolsonaro about an article in the magazine Crusoe claiming that First Lady Michelle Bolsonaro received about $13,000 from Fabricio Quieroz, a former driver for Senator Flavio Bolsonaro, the president’s son, arrested for corruption charges.

“I want to stuff your mouth with punches, ok?” Bolsonaro replied. He did not address the accusation.

Any potential ties to corruption would be particularly damaging to Bolsonaro as his presidential campaign was based largely on his clean record in a nation enduring years of one of the world’s biggest corruption scandals: “Operation Car Wash,” a sprawling kickback scheme in which politicians of nearly every political party took money from contractors like the construction firm Odebrecht in exchange for granting them overly priced government infrastructure contracts. Operation Car Wash led to the impeachment of socialist President Dilma Rousseff and the arrest and conviction of her predecessor and mentor, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.

Bolsonaro has developed an adversarial relationship with the media, as an outsider conservative president facing established press institutions that lean left in the country. He has repeatedly denounced “fake news” meant to smear him in mainstream reports and relied heavily on social media to directly address supporters. Opponents in the government have thus taken to targeting supporters in grassroots social media. In May, Brazil’s top court, the Supreme Federal Tribunal (STF), ordered raids on the homes of 29 people — largely conservative journalists, comedians, and other public Bolsonaro supporters — for allegedly spreading “fake news” about the court.

Media outlets described Bolsonaro’s event on Monday as meant to promote the use of hydroxychloroquine, a drug typically used to fight malaria that has sparked heated global debate over its potential use against Chinese coronavirus.

As scientists only first identified the novel coronavirus in January, researchers have not yet confirmed the effectiveness of any one drug as a therapeutic or for prophylaxis, including hydroxychloroquine (HcQ). The latest peer-reviewed research suggests HcQ it is not helpful for Chinese coronavirus patients.

Bolsonaro personally took hydroxychloroquine throughout his infection, publishing videos of himself on social media taking the drug.

“To those who cheer against hydroxychloroquine, but do not present alternatives, I regret to inform you that I am very well with its use and, with the grace of God, I will live for a long time to come,” Bolsonaro wrote in July.

On Monday, Bolsonaro once again praised the drug and the doctors prescribing it.

“If hydroxychloroquine hadn’t been politicized, a lot more lives could have been saved,” he told the doctors, adding, “history will not remember the weak, cowardly, and silent.”

Bolsonaro has spent months urging Brazilians to attempt to maintain a sense of normalcy throughout the pandemic, visiting businesses personally in an attempt to convince citizens to support the economy. His remarks have prompted outrage on occasion as he has expressed little concern about the threat the virus poses.

“The virus is here, we’re going to have to confront it. Confront it like a man, not a boy!” Bolsonaro said during one public appearance in March, telling the country, “We’re all going to die one day.”

Bolsonaro has also referred to the virus as a “little cold.”

Having initially reported a low number of cases, Venezuela is now experiencing a surge in infection rates that are placing excessive pressure on its decrepit health system. As a result, the socialist regime has started imposing forced isolation tactics similar to those used in China.

The process has now begun to backfire. Many people are now actively avoiding tests or buying them off the black market so they are not forced into state-run isolation centers, where thousands of people are crammed into warehouses with little to no food, a dodgy water supply, and heightened risk of infection.

“This worked in China, which has a much more robust public health system,” Maria Graciela Lopez, head of Venezuela’s Society of Infectology, told the outlet. “Venezuela was already very short on medical staff. People are afraid. Now patients arrive immediately needing intensive care because they lived with the disease at home until they just couldn’t any longer.”

Despite Lopez’s claim, it is not clear that China’s strategy of welding civilians shut in their homes resulted in limited infection rates. China claims only 89,738 coronavirus cases and less than 5,000 deaths. A report by the American Enterprise Institute found that China’s official statistics may be off by millions of cases.

Dictator Nicolás Maduro has long admitted his admiration for China, one of his regime’s closest allies, and employed similar tactics to those used by the Chinese Communist Party when the pandemic started.

“Venezuela has paid attention to every single step and learned big lessons from China,” Maduro said in April after a phone call with his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping. “It has inspired our decisions in how to face this pandemic.”

The regime has turned to strong-arm tactics to enforce rules around mask-wearing and social distancing, with soldiers punishing people with physical exercise, trash-collecting, or listening to lectures about why they should follow the rules. Unlike other countries, authorities have refrained from handing out fines, presumably because the economic and humanitarian crisis means very few people would be able to pay them.

Last month, Voice of America reported that Venezuelan authorities have confiscated privately-owned motels and turned them into prisons for the infected. Conditions in the facilities were described as “deplorable,” with detainees being deprived of basic hygiene and living essentials such as soap, toothpaste, or deodorant.

The buildings were also repeatedly subject to long power outages due to failure’s in the country’s National Grid, while detainees were constantly monitored by police and a councilor from the ruling Socialist Party of Venezuela (PSUV) to prevent their escape or anyone from visiting them.

As of Tuesday afternoon, Venezuela has officially recorded 40,338 cases of the coronavirus and 337 deaths. However, such figures must be viewed with skepticism due to the widespread lack of testing and the regime’s infamous record of dishonesty on matters of public health.

1006,http://www.breitbart.com/latin-america/2020/08/25/bolivian-government-evo-morales-may-have-fathered-child-minor/,2020-08-25T00:00:00,breitbart,"A senior Bolivian official on Monday confirmed the existence of an investigation into a birth certificate that lists former socialist leader Evo Morales as the father of a child born to a 16-year-old girl in 2016.

The revelation that authorities are attempting to confirm if Morales indeed fathered a child with a minor, thus committing statutory rape, follows the publication of a bombshell report in the Spanish media outlet OK Diario this month claiming that Bolivian police have compiled a 46-page report accusing Morales of maintaining a long-term affair with another minor. OK Diario published multiple photos of Morales with a teenage girl it claimed were included in the report.

Bolivian officials have already filed charges against Morales for a litany of violent crimes including genocide, terrorism, destruction of public property, and environmental crimes.

Following the confirmation by Bolivia’s conservative government that it is indeed engaged in a legal investigation against Morales for statutory rape, the governor of Bolivia’s largest state claimed that “everybody knew” Morales was sexually interested in girls while he was in office.

Morales was president of Bolivia for nearly 14 years when he resigned in November following an election victory international observers deemed highly suspect. Morales was not constitutionally allowed to run for a third term but successfully pressured the Bolivian courts to allow him to do so, arguing that term limits were a violation of his human rights. An Organization of American States (OAS) investigation into the October 2019 election found evidence of fraud favoring Morales.

Following his voluntary resignation, Morales claimed he was the victim of a “coup” and fled to Mexico, then Argentina, where the socialist government has granted him political asylum. Morales remains the leader of Bolivians “Movement Towards Socialism” (MAS) party from abroad.

“Today … documentation has been received regarding a possible new case of rape, presumably committed by ex-President Evo Morales,” Guido Melgar, Bolivia’s minister of transparency, told reporters on Monday. “The documentation indicates that a young lady [named] N.N. had a romantic relationship with Evo Morales and became pregnant when she was 15 years and five months old, having a daughter in February 2016, when she was 16.”

“The minor exists, the mother exists, and the minor has registered as her father Juan Evo Morales Ayma,” Melgar explained.

Prosecutors in Cochabamba, the jurisdiction where the case would fall, confirmed on Monday that criminal charges exist against Morales for rape and human trafficking. The next day, Javier Issa, Bolivia’s vice minister of the Department of the Interior, told reporters that police have compiled photographic evidence indicating that the accusations are true. Issa said that the discovery of photos appearing to show Morales in compromising positions with minors was “a matter of chance,” as the Bolivian newspaper Página Siete reported — police discovered the photos after arresting a minor at a party violating Chinese coronavirus lockdown restrictions who appeared to have ties to Morales.

Morales addressed the claims in an interview with the leftist radio program Kawsachun Coca this weekend, reminding the public that he has faced other paternity claims in the past and denying that he had committed any crime.

“I don’t discuss [female] comrades in political matters,” Morales insisted. “All I will tell you is that, during the 2014 elections, some will remember, a case surfaced of a [female] comrade that I had allegedly impregnated, she said she was 55. … I said, ‘if you have evidence, put me on trial.'”

Morales insisted that right-wing “coup plotters” were behind the accusations.

Other news outlets have noted that Morales faced similar paternity claims in 2016, as well.

“All that stuff about rape and pedophilia, everybody knew about that when Evo Morales was president,” Rubén Costas, the governor of Bolivia’s Santa Cruz department, the nation’s equivalent of provinces or states, told reporters on Monday, suggesting that the allegations were true. “We knew and it was all covered up. That’s what happens when power is managed in a vile way and all the institutions are bought off … nobody could do anything about the charges, nothing happened.”

President Jeanine Áñez — a conservative senator who became commander-in-chief after Morales and everyone above her on the chain of command fled the country — called the accusations against Morales “unforgivable” on Tuesday.

“All these acts should be punished, we are in favor of respecting women, children, but we had a president who hid all of that, it will not remain unpunished, this is unforgivable and outrageous for all Bolivians,” Áñez said.

The child who allegedly gave birth to Morales’ daughter is the second identified this month as a potential Morales victim. The first is a woman believed to be currently 19 years old, but who was underage at the time that photos allegedly of her and Morales indicating a romantic relationship were taken. The photos, and her full identity, appeared in the Spanish outlet OK Diario, which did not independently confirm the relationship, only the police investigation into the matter.

The woman in question released a statement last week saying that police in Bolivia had forced her to claim she had engaged in a sexual relationship with Morales and had traveled to Mexico and Argentina to see him following his resignation.

“I have been the victim of police harassment,” the girl said in a statement published anonymously in Bolivian media. “There were various police officers at all times who called me a liar, insulted me, said bad words to me, made fun of me. They told me, ‘say that you are Evo’s girlfriend, that you traveled to Mexico and Argentina.'”

“From July 6 on, my life has been a nightmare,” the statement read.

The known criminal charges against Morales, which Áñez’s government has vowed to take to international court, regard his calls from abroad for mob violence to force his reinstatement as president. In December, Bolivian officials published audio of what they claimed to be Morales’ voice ordering a senior labor union leader, “do not let food into the cities,” hoping to starve residents into allowing his return to power.

A reporter from the newspaper O Globo asked Bolsonaro on Sunday about a story in a different publication that linked First Lady Michelle Bolsonaro to the president’s old friend Fabricio Queiroz, a former police officer and until recently an adviser to Flavio Bolsonaro, the president’s 39-year-old son and a sitting member of the Brazilian Senate.

Flavio Bolsonaro has been embroiled in a corruption probe since last year, an investigation his father denounced as a political hit job. The allegations say Queiroz ran a scheme on behalf of the younger Bolsonaro that involved skimming money from the salaries of phantom employees.

The article that incensed Jair Bolsonaro on Sunday was published by a magazine called Crusoe last month. It charged that Queiroz deposited some $13,000 in checks from government employees into Michelle Bolsonaro’s account over a span of five years, beginning in 2011.

Queiroz was arrested in June after laying low for the past year, leading to taunts of “Where is Queiroz?” from President Bolsonaro’s opponents. Crusading against corruption was a major theme of Bolsonaro’s run for the presidency.

In response to the O Globo reporter asking about the Crusue report, Bolsonaro referred to the reporter as “naughty” and replied, “I want to stuff your mouth with punches, ok?”

Bolsonaro reportedly departed the press conference without taking any further questions. According to Fox News, “a social media campaign saw journalists and citizens tweet the reporter’s question at the president” numerous times on Sunday and Monday.

O Globo issued a statement repudiating “President Jair Bolsonaro’s aggression against a newspaper reporter who was just doing their job performing his role, in a totally professional manner.”

The Brazilian National Association of Journalists said it was “unfortunate” that Bolsonaro reacted “aggressively and without fear to a question from a journalist.”

Bolsonaro addressed the controversy on Twitter Monday, accusing the owners of O Globo, the Marinho family, of their own corruption.

“For at least ten years the Globo network has persecuted me and have managed to prove nothing against me,” Bolsonaro wrote. “Now I await explanations from the Marinho family over the allegation from the ‘money changer of money changers’ that funds over 1 billion reais [$178.7 million] would be passed over to them.”

Bolsonaro also posted a link to a story detailing alleged involvement by the Globo network owners (Globo includes the newspaper and a television network, among other properties) in money laundering.

– Há pelo menos 10 anos o sistema Globo me persegue e nada conseguiram provar contra mim. – Agora aguardo explicações da família Marinho sobre a delação do ""doleiro dos doleiros"", onde valores superiores a R$ 1 bilhão teriam sido repassados a eles. pic.twitter.com/ZRS730K5Pg — Jair M. Bolsonaro (@jairbolsonaro) August 24, 2020

Despite the Queiroz controversy, a great deal of criticism for how Bolsonaro has handled the coronavirus pandemic, and the president himself contracting the virus, recent polls found his approval rating climbing to all-time highs. Reuters speculated that much of his growing support from the poor has been due to an emergency relief program for low-income workers.

According to the general of the Peruvian National Police, Orlando Velasco Mujica, police received a call warning them that an illegal party was taking place at the Thomas Restobar in Lima’s Los Olivos district. Lima is currently under a strict lockdown to prevent the spread of the Chinese coronavirus, banning public gatherings.

When police arrived to storm the venue, some 120 partygoers attempted to flee, causing a deadly stampede where 12 women and one man were crushed and ultimately suffocated.

La Republica reported that police arrested 23 people at the scene, including a 16-year-old who sneaked out of his home. All detainees were subject to a coronavirus test, for which 15 tested positive. Of these, 13 were sent to mandatory isolation, while the others were considered no longer contagious.

Also subject to testing were the 38 police agents involved in the raid, all of whom authorities have also placed in quarantine, and the dead, of which 11 reportedly tested positive for coronavirus.

In a statement, the country’s Interior Ministry tried to deflect blame onto the “unscrupulous business owner” running the event in defiance of restrictions imposed by the Chinese coronavirus.

“The Ministry of the Interior profoundly regrets the deaths of 13 people as a consequence of the criminal irresponsibility of an unscrupulous business owner,” the statement said.

Local media outlet Peru21 noted that the nightclub recently received a government loan from a program entitled “Reactivate Peru,” set up as a response to the economic impact of the pandemic.

The tragedy took place as Peru continues to struggle against the coronavirus, reporting 594,326 cases and 27,663 deaths. Although this is well below other places such as Brazil and the United States, Peru’s population of just 32 million people means that it has the second-highest number of deaths per million (DPM) people (864.76). Only Belgium has a higher rate, recording 864.76 DPM, while the United Kingdom lags behind in a distant third at 623.1 DPM.

In April, nine Peruvian prisoners died during a prison riot demanding better sanitary conditions as a safeguard against the virus’s spread. Prisons are known to be high-risk facilities in terms of contagion, leading to many countries releasing non-violent or low-risk criminals to house arrest.

Top health officials previously described this milestone as a worst-case scenario or “catastrophic” level when they first began to talk about the pandemic and the potential death toll at the start of the year.

The most recent figures released by Mexican health officials point to 556,216 confirmed cases and 60,254 fatalities. However, the true figures are likely much higher as Mexico is one of the countries with the worst levels of testing worldwide.

The figures place Mexico at the number three spot for most fatalities, just behind the U.S. and Brazil. Mexico is also number seven on the worldwide list of nations with most cases.

Reaching 60,000 fatalities was previously described as “catastrophic” by Mexico’s Undersecretary of Health, Hugo Lopez Gatell who, in a streamed news conference in June, forecasted coronavirus deaths to reach possibly 20,000 or 30,000 or in a “catastrophic” scenario, as many as 60,000.

Surpassing the “catastrophic” scenario comes at a time when Mexico is likely to have a much higher true number of cases with many going unreported. Since the pandemic started, Mexico only conducted 1,253,432 tests nationwide — a figure that health experts claim is leading to widespread undercounting.

(Sigh)… I am still crying for MEXICO: WHO says Mexico pandemic is “underrepresented”.

The number of tests per million inhabitants places Mexico at #153 or one of the nations that test the least worldwide, a series of worldwide charts at Worldometers.info revealed.

At the start of the pandemic, Lopez Gatell claimed that the low number of tests was based on a statistical model called Sentinel. The model purported to estimate a true figure. Just weeks into the pandemic arriving in Mexico, however, Lopez Gatell refused to disclose the most recent estimates from the Sentinel Model. Because Lopez Gatell limited testing for serious cases, Mexican health officials appear to be unable to provide a realistic figure for the number of asymptomatic cases in Mexico.

1010,http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2020/08/22/tragedy-venezuela-endless-gasoline-shortage/,2020-08-22T00:00:00,breitbart,"Vehicle lines so large that you may as well consider them an outdoor camping trip, rationed gasoline that counts towards your monthly quotas, and abject despair: Welcome to the new normal of refueling in post-collapse socialist Venezuela.

The country with the largest proven oil reserves in the world makes refueling an uphill battle for its citizens. It sounds incongruous, but that’s how things go down here. An obliterated oil industry with crumbling refineries (courtesy of the ruling Socialist Party), zero oil rigs left operating in the nation, and the latest seizure of the palliative Iranian fuel shipment means that there’s no apparent end to this crisis in sight.

Gasoline shortages aren’t a new phenomenon for us. It is an ongoing and recurring problem, a cycle that gets worse with each new spin of the wheel, and yet another consequence of the past years of utter socialist collapse. But they’ve never been this severe before, and the whole situation has not just made our lives more miserable, it’s even caused a cultural shock for my fellow citizens.

You don’t know what you have until it’s gone, and gasoline is one thing you can add to Venezuela’s ever-growing list of lost treasures, along with freedom of speech, a functional currency, and even hope itself. Absurdly cheap gasoline (to the point that it might as well be free) was our one prerogative as a nation. It used to be cheaper than the simplest bottle of water, or even bubblegum.

We certainly had a plethora of problems here, but having to worry about fuel efficiency wasn’t one of them. Not anymore, though. You have to be extremely frugal with what fuel you can pump into your vehicle, down to the last drop, because it’s not like we can simply go to a fuel station and do the deed at our earliest convenience.

In terms of queuing for gasoline, August has been exceptionally dire. As the capital and seat of power of the “Bolivarian, Socialist, Anti-imperialist, and profoundly Chavista” Revolution, Caracas often suffers the least when it comes to shortages of any kind, so when the shortages begin to hit the capital then you know it’s bad.

The second week of August 2020 saw 46 of Caracas’ fuel stations without fuel or close to running out, and it got progressively worse throughout the week. If you’re not in Caracas then you’d best be prepared to spend an entire week camping on your vehicle for a few liters of fuel. You might as well bring a tent and chill because, my friend, the ride never ends.

When you’re a socialist regime and you can’t quell or mask inhumanely long lines, what do you do? You make them illegal, of course.

The chief of the Integral Defense Operations Zones for the State of Lara has recently announced that overnight queuing at a gas station for fuel is now strictly forbidden. This may be outrageous to you, but for us, it’s nothing new. In 2015, the same tactic was applied to supermarkets to obfuscate the long lines of people waiting for food:

#Lara | En la zona del Triángulo del Este, en Barquisimeto, la GN y PNB amenaza a través de sus altavoces para que retiren los vehículos, sino serán remolcados.

While it’s not an official mandate, 30 liters (~7.9 gallons) is what station operators are pumping to vehicles. If you’re at one of the fuel stations that offer subsidized fuel, it gets debited from your monthly 120-litre allowance via the regime’s Chinese-inspired Fatherland system.

As the socialist system’s monthly allotments are assigned to individuals rather than vehicles, people have begun to transfer their monthly quotas among themselves, either via the system itself or by simply being present at the moment of refueling. The system, however, will only grant allotments to people with registered vehicles, which I am unable to complete due to a bureaucratic paperwork conundrum.

Thus, for all intents and purposes, I am part of the group of people who do not have access to subsidized gasoline, which makes me a second-rate citizen within the framework of this crisis.

Chinese coronavirus quarantine notwithstanding, a few protests have erupted throughout this ongoing calamity – some more peaceful than others. A 19-year-old fisherman was murdered by the National Guard in July. His crime? Protesting for gasoline so that he could work.

One can rightfully wonder if the “radical” quarantine lockdowns that have created a prison-like reality for those stranded in Venezuela have more to do with reducing the effects of the fuel shortages than our health. For some, fuel can be a matter of life and death.

Like water, power, food, and medicine, gasoline shortages and rations are here to stay as part of the next stage in the inexorable collapse of socialist Venezuela. What better way to encapsulate this chapter of our tragedy than by noticing a socialist ambulance being pushed after it ran out of gas — and then getting arrested for filming it.

Citing international intelligence agencies, Duque said that talks about such a sale are in their preliminary stages.

“There is information from international intelligence organisms that work with us which shows there is interest from the dictatorship of Nicolas Maduro in acquiring some medium and long-range missiles through Iran,” said Duque. “The information is that (the missiles) still haven’t arrived but there has been contact especially under instructions from (Venezuela Defense Minister Vladimir) Padrino.”

“We have longstanding but also confirmed intelligence information that members of the Venezuelan Guard are seeking weapons from other countries, particularly from Russia and Belarus,” he continued. “Fortunately we have the capacity to know and condemn.”

Duque, a right-wing conservative allied with the United States, made the claim days after meeting with the Trump administration’s national security adviser, Robert C. O’Brien, as well as other top officials in the nation’s capital.

The revelation raises new questions about Maduro’s intended influence on the region, having transformed the once-wealthy South American country into a Cuban-style communist dictatorship and one of the world’s worst-performing economies. Colombia is one of the more than 50 nations that refuse to recognize Maduro as Venezuela’s rightful leader, as it continues to suffer under the impact of Venezuela’s unprecedented economic and political crisis.

Since 2015, Colombia has accepted close to two million Venezuelans fleeing their homeland, many of whom are in need of humanitarian assistance. They have also accused Maduro of funding and supporting Marxist guerilla groups that have destabilized Colombia over the past two decades, such as the People’s Liberation Army (ELN), that continue to carry out terrorist attacks against security forces and the civilian population.

Just this week, Iran showcased its weapons capability by highlighting new surface-to-surface ballistic and cruise missiles in an obvious rebuke to the United States, which is demanding the regime halt its weapons program. According to Defense Minister Amir Hatami, the two missiles were produced by Iranian scientists and boast a range of over 1,000 kilometers and are named after the Iranian Maj. Gen. Qasem Soleimani, whom the U.S. killed in a drone strike this year.

Meanwhile, Maduro has long prioritized military spending over just about everything, demanding loyalty from high-ranking generals in return for high salaries and effective impunity.

Relations between Iran and Venezuela have become closer throughout the past few years, the two countries strengthening their alliance in response to economic sanctions the U.S. imposed against their respective regimes. Signs of this relationship include the growing number of oil shipments sent from Tehran, the opening of Persian supermarkets in Caracas, and reports that Maduro is allowing Iranian terror-proxy Hezbollah to use Venezuela as its Latin American operating base.

Of the estimated 325 vessels fishing in the waters just outside the Galápagos, 149 have cut off their communications systems in recent months, Ecuador navy commander Rear Admiral Darwin Jarrin said at a press briefing Tuesday according to Reuters.

“In this period, 149 ships have turned off their satellite systems … we know the name[s] of the ships,” he said.

The crews of some fishing boats have also changed the name of their vessels in an attempt to confuse authorities monitoring them, the navy commander added.

The intentionally evasive actions of the Chinese fishing vessels represent “a breach (of protocol) on the high seas because they do not want us to know what they are doing and the activities they carry out,” Ecuador Defense Minister Oswaldo Jarrin said at the news conference.

The defense minister said that turning off satellite equipment violates rules set by Regional Fisheries Management Organizations (RFMOs), a group of international agencies promoting sustainable fishing worldwide.

The predominantly Chinese fishing fleet has operated just outside the Galápagos Islands marine preserve — located off the coast of Ecuador within the country’s exclusive economic zone — for months. In late July, Ecuador’s navy said it was “on alert” over the fishing fleet as it inched “very close” to the edge of Ecuador’s exclusive economic zone, according to the Galápagos Islands’ Gov. Norman Wray.

“[L]ong fishing lines from the Chinese vessels could be drifting into [Ecuador’s] exclusive economic zone,” Luis Villanueva, a member of the Pew Bertarelli Ocean Legacy Project, said at the time. Though yet unproven this summer, China’s illegal fishing both within Ecuador’s exclusive economic zone and inside the Galápagos marine preserve — protected as a UNESCO world heritage site for its sensitive biodiversity — has been documented in years past.

In August 2017, Ecuador authorities seized a Chinese vessel caught illegally fishing within the boundaries of the Galápagos Marine Reserve. Authorities arrested 20 of the boat’s crew members, who were found with 6,600 sharks on board, including near-extinct or endangered species, such as hammerhead sharks.

On August 2, the U.S. State Department issued a statement supporting Ecuador as it monitored China’s hundreds-strong fishing fleet near the Galápagos this summer.

“We firmly support Ecuador’s efforts to ensure [People’s Republic of China] PRC-flagged vessels do not engage in illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing and stand with States whose economies and natural resources are threatened by PRC-flagged vessels’ disregard for the rule of law and responsible fishing practices,” U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said.

While Ecuador seeks to discourage illegal fishing within its exclusive economic zone, it also likely hopes to avoid confrontation with China, “its largest financier and a major market for its shrimp export business,” according to Reuters.",Chinese Fishing Boats near Galapagos Turn Off Tracking Systems,fake

On Saturday, authorities arrested two Venezuelan pilots, Luis Alberto Patino and Gregori Mendez, who were consequently charged with possessing illegal firearms and a large amount of U.S. currency in a suspected smuggling operation.

The statement read:

U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), Air and Marine Operations (AMO) Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), and CBP’s Office of Field Operations (OFO), conducted an outbound investigation of a suspicious aircraft on Saturday, August 15th., locating a weapons stockpile along with a large amount of U.S. currency. AMO agents from the Fort Lauderdale Marine Unit were alerted of an aircraft movement related to an ongoing investigation on Saturday evening. Officers from CBP’s OFO, HSI, and the FAA responded to detain the aircraft headed to St. Vincent and conducted an inspection of the Learjet.

The agency also provided further details about the seizure:

HSI arrested two Venezuelan nationals. The AMO Fort Lauderdale Marine Unit seized the aircraft and one vehicle. OFO officers seized 18 assault/bolt action rifles with optics, six shotguns, 58 semi-automatic pistols, $20,312 in U.S. currency, and $2,618.53 in endorsed checks. In Fiscal Year 2019, AMO enforcement actions resulted in the seizure or disruption of 284,825 pounds of cocaine, 101,874 pounds of marijuana, 51,058 pounds of methamphetamine, 935 weapons and $34.1 million, 1,575 arrests, 52,036 apprehensions of illegal aliens.

Jared Rine, a special agent with Homeland Security Investigations, said in an affidavit supporting the criminal complaint that one of the pilots admitted after his arrest that the plane was ultimately destined for Venezuela.

“From my training and experience, I know that pilots have filed flight plans to third party countries to avoid detection of their ultimate destinations to avoid scrutiny of law enforcement authorities,” Rine wrote. “CBP officers observed that the aircraft was fully loaded, from the cockpit back to the lavatory, with cases and boxes of weapons, ammunition, and household goods.”

It is not clear for what and for whom the cargo was intended, although the pilot’s attempts to avoid scrutiny indicate it may have been in support of Nicolás Maduro’s socialist dictatorship. The arrests comes as tensions between the U.S. and Venezuela continue to escalate, with the Trump administration imposing multiple rounds of economic sanctions in a bid to squeeze and ultimately oust the Maduro regime.

On Tuesday, Bloomberg reported that the U.S. is considering fresh sanctions aimed at halting any remaining fuel imports with the crisis-stricken nations. According to officials familiar with the matter, the measures would target crude swaps with companies in Asia and Europe, although the talks remain ongoing as a final decision has not been yet reached.

Joaquin Castro (D-TX) launched a scathing rebuke of Hollywood and the film industry on Monday, declaring the need for a “reckon[ing] with its systemic injustice and exclusion of our communities.”

In a guest column for Variety magazine entitled “Latinos Love Hollywood, but Hollywood Hates Latinos,” Castro points out the fact that Hispanic actors are indeed underrepresented in film. The Texas Democrat also accuses the industry of casting and depicting Latinos as negative stereotypes, particularly people who are criminals or angry antagonists.

He wrote:

The entertainment industry is the main narrative-creating and image-defining institution of American society. Unfortunately, Latinos are often depicted as stereotypes, if we’re represented at all. A study by the USC Annenberg Inclusion Initiative found that Latinos had a speaking role in less than 5% of movies. Of these characters, nearly 50% were criminals or “angry.” These negative depictions are often the only images that millions of Americans see. Even when positive stories do get told, they are often overlooked by the awards shows that could encourage more production. Let’s not forget: Generations of Latino actors have felt forced to change their name, even their appearance, to be included in roles, forfeiting their heritage and robbing our community of role models and dreams of being seen on-screen.

Castro went on to argue that the situation is so serious that it needs a form of government intervention, complaining how the industry is already subsidized by taxpayer dollars:

At the heart of this failure of representation is the lack of diversity in the industry, especially among those in positions of creative authority, such as writers, producers, directors and executives. Latinos prop up Hollywood economically, accounting for nearly one in four of all box office ticket sales, but they account for a mere 4% of directors and 3% of producers. This cannot be an accident in a city like Los Angeles, where Latinos are nearly half the population. Hollywood is in effect a redlined industry, generating wealth and opportunity for the handful of conglomerates who run it while excluding the hardworking Latinos who live all around it. The case for government intervention is clear: Hollywood is failing to include Latinos on its own, meriting increased scrutiny from community leaders and elected officials. Taxpayer dollars flowing to an exclusionary industry, particularly in the form of production credits, deserve special attention. Why should we subsidize exclusion?

It is not the first time that Castro and Democrats in Congress have called out Hollywood for overlooking Latinos. Last month, the Congressional Hispanic Caucus (of which Castro is the leader) slammed the Emmy Awards for their “erasure” of Latino actors after not a single actor was nominated for an award.

“There is not a single Latino or Latina nominated for [The Emmy] awards,” the Caucus, which comprises solely of Democrats, wrote at the time. “A demoralizing disappointment for the U.S.’s largest minority group, representing nearly 1-in-5 Americans. Hollywood must acknowledge and address the erasure of Latinx actors.”

In 2018, left-wing activist groups such as the National Hispanic Media Coalition and National Latino Media Council even boycotted Paramount Pictures and demonstrated outside their studios for their “dismal hiring record of Latino talent.” The company responded by pledging to continue fostering an environment of “diversity, inclusion and belonging.”

A report from the Associated Press this weekend found that increasing numbers of people from the coastal town of La Guaira, close to the capital of Caracas, are using the method to provide sustenance for themselves and their families.

Often traveling in groups, participants swim up to five miles off the coastline in order to secure food for themselves and their families. Beaches are closed because of the pandemic, although these restrictions are routinely ignored.

“If we had steady work, we wouldn’t risk our lives out there,” 35-year-old Juan Carlos Almeida told the agency. “We’re bricklayers, but there’s no construction… If we don’t help ourselves and don’t go to work, who’s going to feed us? Nobody.”

The voyages carry significant risk, with swimmers facing strong currents, which if mishandled can cause them to drown. There is also the risk of being bitten by a shark should they try to grab their catch. Once arriving back onshore, swimmers are often forced to walk for miles holding their catch to return home.

Such voyages underline the dire circumstances faced by millions of Venezuelans, as the country’s economic situation is exacerbated by lockdown measures imposed by the socialist regime since March. In February, a study from the United Nations Food Program determined that one in three Venezuelans (roughly 9.3 million) are facing severe hunger, with this figure only likely to have risen as quarantine measures have put millions of people out of work.

Like many parts of Latin America, Venezuela has experienced a surge in coronavirus cases over the past six weeks, reporting 33,755 and 281 deaths. However, many analysts suspect this figure may well be higher given the lack of testing and the decrepit nature of the country’s healthcare system.

Two senior U.S. officials involved in the seizures told the Associated Press that they did not employ military force during the operation and that the ships themselves were not confiscated. Instead, officials threatened ship owners, insurers, and captains with targeted sanctions to make them hand over their cargo.

According to another official, the four tankers were headed for Venezuela to deliver 1.1 million barrels of gasoline, a resource which the country is currently desperately short on. However, the seizure meant they never arrived at their destination and went missing, with two of the ships later showing up on the island of Cape Verde in the central Atlantic Ocean. They have since remained unaccounted for.

The Justice Department confirmed the incident late Friday morning, declaring it as the “largest-ever seizure of fuel shipments” from Iran:

The Justice Department today announced the successful disruption of a multimillion dollar fuel shipment by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), a designated foreign terrorist organization, that was bound for Venezuela. These actions represent the government’s largest-ever seizure of fuel shipments from Iran. The government announced today that it has successfully executed the seizure order and confiscated the cargo from all four vessels, totaling approximately 1.116 million barrels of petroleum. With the assistance of foreign partners, this seized property is now in U.S. custody.

According to the statement, the Iranians then attempted to recover the shipments by boarding an “unrelated ship” in what was described as an “unsuccessful” operation:

After enforcement of the U.S. forfeiture order, Iran’s navy forcibly boarded an unrelated ship in an apparent attempt to recover the seized petroleum but was unsuccessful. U.S. Central Command published a video of the failed Iranian operation yesterday. Funds successfully forfeited with a connection to a state sponsor of terrorism may in whole or in part be directed to the United States Victims of State Sponsored Terrorism Fund.

Responding to the initial reports, the Iranian ambassador to Venezuela, Hojat Soltani, dismissed the reports as “yet another lie and psychological warfare” by the United States.

“The ships are not Iranian, and neither the owner nor its flag has anything to do with Iran,” Soltani wrote on Twitter in Spanish. “This is another lie and act of psychological warfare perpetrated by the US propaganda machine. The terrorist Trump cannot compensate for his humiliation and defeat by Iran using false propaganda.”

The seizure represents another blow to the Maduro regime, which despite Venezuela having the second-largest oil reserves in the world, currently finds itself unable to provide sufficient gasoline to its population. The widespread shortages have led to multiple fuel protests as people are forced to wait hours or even days to access gasoline, while no longer enjoying the government subsidies that allowed them to repeatedly fill up their vehicles for just a fraction of a cent.

The seizure will be seen in Washington as a victory for the Trump administration’s policy of maximum pressure against the Maduro regime, which has so far failed to remove him from power despite imposing an array of tough economic sanctions against senior socialist officials and the country’s vital oil industry.

With both countries under economic sanctions, the alliance between Iran and Venezuela has become closer over the past few years. As well as multiple oil shipments, the two rogue states have started initiatives such as the opening of an Iranian supermarket in Caracas and the signing of various “scientific and technological” agreements aimed at tightening cultural, diplomatic, and economic ties.

The close relationship, forged by socialist dictator Hugo Chávez in the early 21st century, is also increasingly considered as a threat to U.S. national security, as the Maduro regime is believed to be permitting Iran’s terror proxy Hezbollah to use Venezuelan territory as a base to expand their operations across Latin America.

The Associated Press reported that father and son Mark and Joseph Grenon were arrested in the northern beach town of Santa Marta from where they allegedly shipped their “Miracle Mineral Solution” to the United States, Africa, and other parts of Colombia, which has experienced a recent surge in coronavirus cases. Prosecutors allege that at least seven people have died from taking the concoction.

Mark Grenon – who is also the self-described archbishop of the Genesis II Church of Health and Healing in Bradenton, Florida – promoted the product as a substance with divine healing powers. In April, he ignored the order of a court in Miami that he must stop selling the solution, which is only legal in Bolivia.

The arrest followed the filing of a federal criminal complaint last month against Grenon and his three sons, Jonathan, 34, Joseph 32, and Jordan, 26, on charges conspiracy to defraud the United States, violations of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and criminal contempt. If convicted of all charges, they will face a maximum of between 14 and 17 years in prison.

According to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the solution sold by the men transforms into bleach when ingested, and is typically used when dealing with textiles, industrial water, pulp, and paper.

“Miracle Mineral Solution has not been approved by the FDA for any use, but these products continue to be promoted on social media as a remedy for treating autism, cancer, HIV/AIDS, hepatitis and flu, among other conditions,” the FDA wrote in a warning last August. “However, the solution, when mixed, develops into a dangerous bleach which has caused serious and potentially life-threatening side effects.”

“Ingesting these products is the same as drinking bleach,” it continued. “Consumers should not use these products, and parents should not give these products to their children for any reason.”

Having initially pledged to abide by District Judge Kathleen Williams’ ruling, Grenon reportedly changed his mind and sent aggressive emails in response.

“We will NOT be participating in any of your UNCONSTITUTIONAL Orders, Summons, etc,” Grenon reportedly wrote in one email. “Again and again I have written you all that . . . you have NO authority over our Church.”

If convicted of all charges, they will face a maximum of between 14 and 17 years in prison.

1018,http://www.breitbart.com/latin-america/2020/08/13/poll-over-80-of-venezuelans-say-juan-guaido-has-deceived-trump/,2020-08-13T00:00:00,breitbart,"A poll released Wednesday revealed the vast majority of Venezuelans believe President Juan Guaidó procured the support of President Donald Trump through deception, claiming falsely he had the support of the Venezuelan armed forces.

The poll, published by the Venezuelan firm Meganálisis, found widespread political unity among Venezuelans – they overwhelmingly oppose both Guaidó and Maduro and oppose socialism as an ideology.

A majority consider Guaidó a socialist.

Guaidó – a member of the Socialist International member party Popular Will until this year – is legitimately the president of the socialist country as a result of dictator Nicolás Maduro refusing to step down after his last legal presidential term ended in January 2019. The federal legislature, the National Assembly, used its constitutional powers to make Guaidó interim president, with a mandate to organize free and fair elections to replace Maduro.

As Maduro commands the loyalty of the armed forces and Venezuela banned the civilian ownership of firearms under late dictator Hugo Chávez, Guaidó has no access to any organized force and has not been able to exercise any of his constitutional powers. The president has also faced repeated physical assaults at the hand of Maduro’s armed socialist gangs, known as colectivos.

Most of the free world recognizes Guaidó’s legitimacy, however, and has offered support in the form of accepting Guaidó-appointed Venezuelan ambassadors.

In April 2019, Guaidó declared that he had convinced the nation’s armed forces to support him and overthrow Maduro. Within hours, Maduro appeared on television alongside his minister of defense and other senior military leaders refuting Guaidó’s claim. No significant number of soldiers defected to Guaidó and Maduro still retains control of the military at press time.

The Trump administration recognized Guaidó as president following his swearing-in. Trump welcomed Guaidó as his personal guest at the 2020 State of the Union speech. By June, however, Trump appeared to express disillusion in Guaidó, saying publicly that he was only “OK” with recognizing Guaidó as president and that he had considered meeting with Maduro.

The Venezuelan polling firm Meganálisis found that respondents to its survey in Venezuela are also showing fatigue with Guaidó, identifying him – like Maduro – as a “socialist” and agreeing that Trump’s support for Guaidó was contingent at least in part on falsehoods.

Meganálisis pollsters took the survey between August 6 and August 10, questioning respondents in 19 states and the Caracas capital district.

Of those asked, 82.4 percent of respondents answered “yes” to the question, “Do you believe that Juan Guaidó, the politicians who represent him, and the opposition National Assembly have deceived President Donald Trump by telling them that they have the support of the Armed Forces and of the majority of Venezuelans?” Another 12.3 percent said they did not know, over twice the number who answered negatively.

Asked if they believed the armed forces supported Guaidó, a slightly higher number, 86.1 percent, said no.

Similar to previous Meganálisis poll results this year, respondents did not appear to view Maduro more favorably as a result of their negative responses to Guaido. A wide majority, 73.8 percent, said they supported the implementation of a new government; 77.6 percent said they wished to see an end to the Maduro regime and chavismo in general. A similar number, 76.7 percent, agreed with the phrase “socialism guarantees misery, regression, and destroys the future.”

That rejection of socialism also informed views of Guaidó, as 66.5 of respondents said they considered Guaidó himself a “socialist.”

The July iteration of Meganálisis’s semi-monthly national poll also found decreased support for Guaidó. At the time, 78.8 percent of respondents said they wished to see Trump stop supporting Guaidó’s bid for the presidency. Asked, “do you think Guaidó is a weak politician?”, 83.1 percent said “yes.”

Like the July survey, Venezuelans told Meganálisis in May, by a factor of nearly 90 percent, that they did not believe Guaidó capable of running the country.

A “tell-all” book by former U.S. National Security Advisor John Bolton claimed this year that Trump appeared to agree with the 83 percent, claiming that the president expressed reservations about supporting a “kid” like Guaidó, who made Maduro looked “tough.” Maduro has been in power since 2013, extending his rule through disingenuous calls for “dialogue” with opposition leaders affiliated with the Socialist International. Bolton had enthusiastically supported Guaidó while in the U.S. government, a likely factor in his removal from his office.

In June, Maduro announced that he had reached an agreement with Guaidó organized through the Pan-American Health Organization (PAHO), a subsidiary of the World Health Organization (W.H.O.) accused of enabling human trafficking, to distribute humanitarian supplies in Venezuela in response to the Chinese coronavirus pandemic.

“Both parties propose to work in coordination, in coordination and with the support of PAHO, in the search for financial resources that contribute to strengthening the country’s response capacities in the face of the new coronavirus,” the Maduro regime’s Communication Minister Jorge Rodríguez claimed. Guaidó confirmed the deal on Twitter, where he distributes most of his communications.

1019,http://www.breitbart.com/latin-america/2020/08/12/report-bolivia-investigating-evo-morales-possible-relationship-minor/,2020-08-12T00:00:00,breitbart,"The Spanish independent media outlet OK Diario claimed this week to have obtained a 46-page secret police report detailing an investigation into a relationship between socialist former president of Bolivia Evo Morales and an underage girl.

OK Diario does not claim to confirm the relationship or have independent evidence of anything untoward — only that the current conservative government of Bolivia is investigating the matter. The online outlet published several photos of Morales alongside a girl the police report allegedly claims was 14 at the time of the relationship. It also published what it claimed to be her government identification card and what it claimed to be evidence of phone records between her number and one allegedly belonging to Morales.

It names the girl, who would be a 19-year-old woman today, and alleges that she made several suspicious trips out of the country following Morales’ voluntary resignation from power in November after the Organization of American States (OAS) published evidence of fraud in his alleged election “victory” a month prior.

Following his resignation, Morales — who had served as president for 13 years and forced constitutional changes through the legislature to get on the ballot in 2019 — fled to Mexico, claiming he had been the victim of a “coup,” and then to Argentina, where the girl identified in the alleged police report allegedly traveled. The conservative government of President Jeanine Áñez took over after his flight from the country only because everyone above her on the chain of command, all members of Morales’ Movement Towards Socialism (MAS) party, also fled the country.

The Pan-American Post reported on Wednesday that a video has surfaced on Bolivian social media allegedly of the girl in question congratulating Morales on their fifth-year anniversary. The video in question appears grainy and its sound does not match the lips of the person speaking in the video.

If Bolivian police eventually pursue charges against Morales, statutory rape in the country is punishable by between three to six years in prison.

OK Diario is an independent outlet founded by journalist Eduardo Inda, formerly of one of Spain’s most prominent newspapers, El Mundo. Journalist Alejandro Entrambasaguas published the Morales story on Sunday, then called Morales personally on Monday to ask for comment. In the recording he published, Morales dismisses the issue entirely, insisting, “I don’t have any comment, they make anything up, I don’t talk about those things.” It is not clear from the recording if Morales meant to refer to the media as “they” or the Bolivian authorities.

Evo Morales se niega a aclarar a @okdiario si mantuvo una relación con una menor: “Yo no hablo de esas cosas”. Se sorprendió al escuchar mi voz. Pero llamarle era mi obligación como periodista. Y @evoespueblo no dio la cara. Es un cobarde. Escuchadlo: https://t.co/CgfcGJkcEn pic.twitter.com/cohAXNrViR — Alejandro Entrambasaguas (@entrammbasaguas) August 10, 2020

Morales has not mentioned the case in any official capacity, nor has he issued any confirmation or denial that the audio published by OK Diario is of his voice.

Bolivian authorities have neither confirmed nor denied at press time that they are investigating the matter.

Morales is nonetheless facing grave charges in the Bolivian justice system. As of Sunday, Minister of Justice and Institutional Transparency Álvaro Coímbra confirmed that the Bolivian government is pursuing charges against Morales for “genocide, terrorism, sedition, crimes against health, against basic services, destruction of public property” and “crimes against the environment.” The charges are related to Morales’ encouragement of socialist violence against the legitimate government to demand his return to power. Morales — who commands significant support among labor unions and indigenous groups — encouraged socialists to take the streets, causing riots in which large groups chanting “here we go, civil war” burned down police stations, emergency vehicles, property in national parks, and caused other destruction.

Bolivian authorities published audio in December of what they claimed was a phone call between Morales and a key labor ally in the country in which the former commanded a blockade to prevent civilians from accessing food to force them to riot in favor of Morales’ return.

“Don’t let food into the cities,” the voice identified as Morales can be heard as saying.

Morales also faces charges of fraud in the October election, brought by his rival, the center-left candidate Carlos Mesa. Mesa testified in his case against Morales on Monday.

Morales spoke at length about several topics in a Facebook Live broadcast on Tuesday from Argentina, where he has received “political asylum” from the socialist government. He did not discuss the allegations of statutory rape, but did mention the riots and physical blockading of cities.

“The government doesn’t want the blockades to end so they can keep blaming us for the crisis,” Morales alleged.

Morales also discussed the Chinese coronavirus pandemic, which he speculated was an intentional attempt to reduce global populations.

“I am almost convinced that the pandemic is part of a biological war,” Morales said. “In the politics of the new world order, it is important to plan the reduction of unnecessary populations. Old people, the handicapped, the poor are no use to capitalism.”

Former President Enrique Pena Nieto (2012-2018) and his former Tax Secretary Luis Videgaray allegedly ordered the disbursement of $100 million pesos ($4.5 million USD) to foreign electoral advisors who worked in the 2012 presidential election, said Mexico’s Attorney General Alejandro Gertz Manero in a video message.

Gertz Manero said Pena Nieto and Videgaray also allegedly ordered the dissemination of $120 million pesos ($5.3 million USD) for vote buying in 2013 and 2014. The allegations are filed as part of an investigation that also implicated five senators and a congressman, the official said.

The information about the alleged bribery and other corrupt activities comes from the statements presented by Emilio Lozoya, the former head of Mexico’s state-owned oil company (PEMEX). Lozoya is currently facing bribery charges and is in modified home detention pending trial.

In recent days, Lozoya cooperated with authorities and presented his statements before Mexican prosecutors. In addition to the two allegations against Pena Nieto and Videgaray, Lozoya also mentioned other bribes including one for $200 million pesos ($8.9 million USD) that were allegedly used to fund an electoral reform in Mexico.

According to Getz Manero, the allegations have been turned over to his staff who will begin the case and track down evidence.

During the highly publicized trial of Sinaloa Cartel kingpin Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman, witnesses pointed to multi-million dollar bribes paid to Pena Nieto and his top security chiefs in exchange for protection. Since leaving office, Pena Nieto has not been active in Mexico’s political scene. Videgaray is a professor at the MIT Sloan School of Management.

Posting his findings on Twitter, Rodríguez explained how Nicolás Maduro’s socialist regime has continued to prop up the Cuban economy despite the unprecedented economic and humanitarian crisis in his own country.

“During the month of July, the government of Nicolás Maduro sent 24,269 barrels of crude oil and condensed gas to Cuba per day,” he wrote. “This represents 8.4 percent of our exports and makes Cuba the fourth most important destination for our oil. So far this year, shipments to Cuba have averaged 32,147 barrels per day or 5.6 percent of our total exports. The estimated value of these exports is approximately $230 million.”

Rodríguez’s data, from the files of the state-run oil company Petróleos de Venezuela (PDVSA), originated at the oil monitor Tanker Trackers.

2. En lo que va de año, los envíos a Cuba han promediado 32 mil 147 barriles diarios, o el 5,6 por ciento de nuestras exportaciones. El valor estimado de estas exportaciones es aproximadamente 230 millones de dólares. — Francisco Rodríguez (@frrodriguezc) August 10, 2020

Rodríguez went on to explain that the two countries try to hide these debts, which date back over the past two decades, by having Venezuela paying ludicrously high prices for Cuban services. The most common service rendered was the importation of slave doctors sent by Havana to prop up Venezuela’s collapsing health service.

“So far this year, shipments to Cuba have averaged 32,147 barrels a day, or 5.6% of our exports. The estimated value of these exports is approximately 230 million dollars,” he wrote, accompanied by several sets of data. “That fraction that is not financed is paid for with exports of Cuban services, including medical services, billed at highly inflated prices.”

“By 2013, we estimate that Venezuela was paying around 200,000 a year for each doctor,” he continued. “The fraction financed has accumulated over time, although it has recently stabilized with the drop in production. We estimate that, by the end of the first quarter of 2020, Cuba owed Venezuela 11.7 billion dollars.”

4. Aquella fracción que no se financia se paga con exportaciones de servicios cubanos, incluyendo servicios médicos, facturados a precios altamente inflados. Para el año 2013, estimamos que Venezuela pagaba alrededor de USD 200 mil al año por cada médico. — Francisco Rodríguez (@frrodriguezc) August 10, 2020

The unwillingness of Venezuela, a country that is effectively bankrupt and currently experiencing widespread gasoline shortages, to properly chase up large debts underlines the extremely close relations between the two countries, which were developed between Hugo Chávez and Fidel Castro following the former’s rise to power in 1998.

Following Maduro’s aggressive transformation of Venezuela to an effective communist dictatorship in recent years, many analysts now consider the South American country to be a mere satellite of the Castro regime, despite the former being far larger with a population almost three times the size of Cuba.

Last year, the Foundation for Human Rights in Cuba released a report detailing how Castro had effectively invaded his Latin American neighbor by installing tens of thousands of secret agents to help increase drug trafficking, alliances with terrorist groups, and theft of natural resources.

Police said in a statement Tuesday that they discovered tens of thousands of litres of chemicals and 100 kilograms (220 pounds) of crack cocaine when they raided the riding school on Friday. They also found sleeping quarters for staff in the building in Nijeveen, 120 kilometres (75 miles) north-east of Amsterdam.

Regime Attorney General William Tarek Saab announced the sentence, claiming both Luke Denman and Airan Berry had “taken responsibility for their actions.”

“The said gentleman admitted to having committed crimes of conspiracy, association, and illicit trafficking of weapons of war and terrorism outlined in the Penal Code, for which they were sentenced to imprisonment for 20 years, [sic] months and nine days,” Saab wrote.

According to Alonso Medina Roe, hired as legal defense by the families of the two men, authorities denied him access to the secretive jailhouse trial and instead provided the men with a public defender. He also revealed that, since his hiring, the regime has prevented him from meeting or speaking with his clients in a flagrant violation of their constitutional rights.

The alleged botched attack, code-named “Operation Gideon,” took place in early May. Maduro’s regime claimed the attack was meant as an invasion to overthrow his illegitimate rule and that the Venezuelan military successfully thwarted it, leading to the deaths of eight men and the detention of 60 rebels.

Maduro’s regime claimed the mastermind behind the operation was Jordan Godreau, another former Green Beret and owner of the Florida-based security firm Silvercorp USA, who allegedly planned the operation from makeshift training camps in neighboring Colombia. Maduro’s officials claimed the operation was poorly planned and executed.

Maduro has repeatedly claimed that the United States and Venezuelan President Juan Guaidó, the actual head of state in the country, were involved in the attack. Both parties have fervently denied any involvement. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has pledged to do everything possible to try and free the two men, however, as they are U.S. citizens.

Venezuela’s socialist regime has long been the subject of plans and attempts to remove it by force as it continues to oversee the transformation of the once-thriving South American country into a satellite of communist Cuba wreaked by an unparalleled economic crisis.

In July 2018, Maduro claimed to be the target of a failed assassination attempt during a military speech in Caracas after a drone exploded meters away from him. Multiple arrests were made but no conclusive evidence has ever been presented as to who was behind the attack or even if it was a legitimate attempt against Maduro’s life.

U.S. President Donald Trump has repeatedly touted the possibility of launching a military intervention to remove Maduro from power. However, the idea has never come to fruition. Trump instead has opted to impose economic sanctions on the regime’s crucial oil industry as a means of weakening Maduro’s grip on power.

Cuba makes billions selling the services of poorly paid medical professionals to friendly states around the world. The Castro regime forces tens of thousands of doctors around the world to work in dangerous locales that domestic doctors do not tend to, offering them a percentage of the salaries the host country agreed to that is not enough for them to survive.

The Wall Street Journal estimated in 2019 that Cuba makes about $11 billion in 60 countries around the world selling slave doctors. The Organization of American States (OAS) denounced the practice in December as “human trafficking.”

Rojas joined the program as a trained orthopedics specialist in 2014. The Castro regime sent him to Ecuador, ruled at the time by socialist ally Rafael Correa (Ecuador has since ordered Correa’s arrest, though he fled to Belgium). There, Rojas said that his main task as a doctor was to spread socialist propaganda in an attempt to boost popular support for Correa.

“All the medical missions have a political ulterior motive,” Rojas said in an interview with the Foundation for Human Rights in Cuba, as relayed by the independent news outlet Cubanet.

“All those who leave [Cuba] for a medical mission have to pass two political courses where they explain to us that the main source of remittances to Cuba are the medical missions. Then they focus on the countries they send us to, the situation of the government [there] and the importance of knowing the achievements of that leftist government, which once there we must

“It’s a trap,” he added.

When he defected in 2016, Rojas was blacklisted from entering the country for at least eight years. His public advocacy, particularly given that he fled Ecuador for the United States, may extend that ban.

“I’ve had to drink my tears after explaining to them why their father can’t go see them, because they think that I don’t love them,” Rojas said of his two children, a 13-year-old daughter and nine-year-old son. “We are the victims of a government that uses us.”

In an interview Rojas offered in July to the outlet Archivo Cuba, he explained that he attempted to enter Cuba twice since his defection, once after his daughter tried to commit suicide and once after his father died. His wife has since legally separated from him, as well, causing more trauma to the children.

“My daughter especially has been hurt by the family separation,” he explained in the Archivo Cuba interview. “My daughter was diagnosed with histrionic personality disorder and a year ago she tried to commit suicide. I traveled to Cuba urgently then and the Cuban government banned me from going in to come in. I was [stuck] in the airport ten hours without being let in.”

Histrionic personality disorder is a psychiatric condition in which a patient shows “an overwhelming desire to be noticed, and often behave dramatically or inappropriately to get attention,” according to the Cleveland Clinic. Threatening to or attempting to commit suicide, sometimes in such a bid for attention, is listed as a symptom and “unpredictable attention given to a child by his or her parent(s)” as a potential cause.

“There are thousands of families in the same situation as me or even worse,” Rojas said. “I lost my father in Cuba. I couldn’t go to the island then either. I lost the father who raised me, just like my biological father … I have lost two uncles very close to me. I have seen my mom suffer, cry.”

Family separations and abuses in the host countries are part of a documented pattern of witness experiences listed by doctors who defect regardless of the country the regime sent them to. Outside of the United States, in Brazil, defecting doctors have launched a class-action lawsuit against the former socialist government there and the Pan-American Health Organization (PAHO), a subdivision of the World Health Organization (W.H.O.), which intervened to ensure the deal between Cuba and Brazil did not violent international sanctions.

Doctors participating in that lawsuit described a fraudulent and abusive system in a press conference last year, noting that they often fabricated data and threw away medicine to appear more productive than they were. When they did meet patients, the regime obligated them to pressure the patients into supporting local socialists.

In Venezuela, where many of them worked, the Cuban dictatorship “had us under constant harassment and stress,” doctor Tatiana Carballo said last year. “The thing that bothers me the most is that they made us falsify statistics and … to influence the population politically — in other words, to force Venezuelans, against their will, to vote for Maduro or Chávez.”

“They tell us often in Cuba that education is free, therefore we are their property,” Carballo said of Cuban regime agents. “From the moment we graduate, we receive very, very low salaries, then begin medical missions abroad.”

“We had to tell patients about the positive things the Maduro regime was doing and influence the vote,” Fidel Cruz, another defecting doctor, said. “I had to go door-to-door to incentivize people to vote for Maduro during the last election.”

Ramona Matos, another doctor at the press conference, testified to fabricating data.

“On a daily basis, you had to write on a piece of paper fake names, fake dates of birth, fake medical conditions, for patients we never saw,” she said, referring to her world in Bolivia under socialist ex-president Evo Morales. “These were statistics the agents following and controlling us forced us to write. If we didn’t write that down, we had to go back to Cuba without our salary and we’d lose the money frozen in our accounts.”

The survey, which asked questions on topics ranging from acceptance of homosexuality to trust in government in countries around the world, found that 56 percent of Colombians either have little or no trust in the W.H.O., a U.N. body at the forefront of dealing with the Chinese coronavirus pandemic. These figures were in line with a broader trend among Colombians, who have very little trust in national and international institutions.

Initially less affected than Europe, Asia, and the United States by the Chinese coronavirus pandemic, Colombia is among one of the many Latin American countries that has documented an aggressive uptick in cases over recent weeks. As of Friday, health officials have recorded 357,710 cases and nearly 12,000 deaths nationwide. Around 192,000 people have reportedly made a full recovery. The country has also been in a nationwide quarantine since mid-March, making it one of the longest quarantines worldwide.

The data is indicative of people’s increasing lack of trust in the organization, which has seen its reputation heavily damaged since the outbreak of the pandemic because of its close ties to China.

In June, leaked documents indicated that W.H.O. officials were aware of the fact that China’s communist regime was withholding vital information about the outbreak in January. At the same time, the organization’s leader, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, was lavishing praise on Beijing for its supposed transparency and efforts to contain its spread.

According to data from Pew Research published in June, more than half of Americans also believe that the W.H.O. has done a “fair” or “poor” job in its coronavirus response. One of the most fervent critics of the organization is President Donald Trump, who announced in April that he would be putting a halt on funding, describing them as “very China-centric.” In May, he declared that he was considering partially restoring funding to the sum of $40 million rather than cutting it completely.

The court is investigating if Uribe, who served as president between 2002 and 2010 and remains a senator in the Colombian Congress, paid former paramilitary fighter Juan Guillermo Monsalve to change his testimony over Uribe’s alleged role in setting up the armed group.

As the only entity in Colombia that can investigate former presidents, the court is currently examining 17 claims of criminal activity against Uribe filed by his political opponents. He has vehemently denied all the charges against him.

“The loss of my freedom causes me profound sadness for my wife, for my family, and for the Colombians who still think I did something good for the country,” Uribe wrote on Twitter.

La privación de mi libertad me causa profunda tristeza por mi señora, por mi familia y por los colombianos que todavía creen que algo bueno he hecho por la Patria — Álvaro Uribe Vélez (@AlvaroUribeVel) August 4, 2020

Protests consequently broke out across Colombia, the largest being in Uribe’s home city of Medellín where he has widespread support. Supporters also used the hashtag #MasUribistaQueNunca (“More Pro-Uribe Than Ever”) across social media to denounce his arrest as a witch hunt.

His tenure as president is characterized by cooperation with the Bush administration to use counterterrorism tactics commonly used in the Middle East to weaken the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), a radical Marxist narco-terrorist organization. His action is widely credited for liberating the country from the grip of violent guerilla groups and paving the way for it to become one of Latin America’s more prosperous nations.

While in office, Uribe enjoyed unprecedented approval ratings, although he has become a more polarizing figure in recent years following his vehement opposition to the failed 2016 peace deal with what remained of the FARC forced through by his successor Juan Manuel Santos. The agreement legalized the FARC as a political party and offered it free seats in Congress in return for the group laying down its arms, a promise that it has failed to keep.

President Iván Duque, who rose to power in 2018 on the back of Uribe’s support, responded to the ruling by praising his mentor’s successes while in government.

“During his two [terms of] government, our country regained security, Colombia was put in the eye of investment, and progress was made in social justice,” said Duque. “Within the bounds of the law, Álvaro Uribe confronted drug trafficking, terrorism, and totalitarian regimes in Latin America. I am and will always be a believer in the innocence and honor of someone who, with the examples he has set, has won a place in Colombia’s history.”

Satellite images uploaded to Twitter by the vessel-tracking service TankerTrackers.com showed the black slick off the coast of Falcón state, known for its pristine beaches and tourism.

Based on the data we have now reviewed along with an AIS playback, we have good reason to believe that a cargo vessel departing from #LaGuaira, #Venezuela has spilled its fuel oil following a possible failure.

The chair of the National Assembly’s environmental committee — the only legitimate lawmaking body left in Venezuela — Maria Hernández, warned about the effect on both the environment and water supplies.

“This affects one of our most exquisite coastlines, which is very important for tourism,” Hernandez told Reuters in a telephone interview.

Victoria González, the Falcón coordinator for the environmental advocacy group Fundación Azul Ambientalistas (Blue Environmentalist Foundation), added to the news agency that the slick would threaten life within Morrocoy National Park.

“It will affect the tourism and fishing sectors, which are the principal sources of income for the towns along the coast,” González said. “In the case of oil, a simple cleanup is not enough. It remains on coasts and in bodies of water over time.”

“Satellite image from 4th August 11:30 am,” the South Caribbean Foundation noted on Twitter Tuesday. “The red arrow indicates the position of the spillage. Much of the oil has not yet reached the Falcón coast.”

The Maduro regime has so far refused to comment on the incident. However, a source within the state-run Petroleum of Venezuela (PDSVA) confirmed to Reuters that the oil likely spilled from a ship’s fuel tank and that the company would assist in the cleanup.

As well as the potentially devastating environmental impact of the oil itself, the incident represents the latest embarrassment to the Maduro regime as the country struggles with widespread gasoline shortages that are forcing people to wait hours or even days to fill up their vehicles.

As a result of the shortages, many Venezuelans have held fuel protests in recent months demanding an end to shortages. Despite having the largest oil reserves in the world after the United States, the country’s economic and humanitarian crisis has led to a drastic decline in oil production. In June, overall production reportedly fell for the sixth month running, decreasing by a further 32 percent, forcing authorities to import reserves from allies such as Russia, China, and Iran.

Venezuelans are now also required to provide biometric data when filling up, checked against the government’s database using the “Fatherland Card,” developed by communist China as a way of spying on citizens’ behavior and spending habits. Although fuel prices are still relatively low (around $0.025 a liter), this is still extremely costly for the millions of people living on just a few dollars a month. The regime charges those who exceed the quota they set at $0.50 per liter, meaning only the wealthy can afford to buy a full gas tank.

1029,http://www.breitbart.com/latin-america/2020/08/04/venezuela-man-arrested-filming-socialist-ambulance-running-out-gas/,2020-08-04T00:00:00,breitbart,"Venezuelan socialist authorities reportedly arrested Deivis Pacheco on Monday for filming firemen in the country’s Trujillo state pushing along an ambulance that had run out of gasoline.

Venezuela boasts the world’s second-largest oil reserves after the United States. Yet after two decades of socialist rule and the seizure of its major oil company, Petróleos de Venezuela, its oil production has dropped to 1940s levels, necessitating imports of gasoline from allied countries like Iran. Major fuel shortages have forced thousands nationwide to stand in crowds in front of gas stations, even under a Chinese coronavirus lockdown, and have led to violence over the little gasoline available, with at least two deaths.

Pacheco stands accused of having uploaded a video to social media July 31 showing a Trujillo Fire Department ambulance stuck on the road. several men begin pushing it from behind to get it to a fuel source. The video shows the ambulance moving with the effort of multiple men as the large letters on its side reading “Rescue — Socialist Government of the State of Trujillo” pass by glacially. One of the men pushing can be heard complaining, “come help push instead of standing there recording,” to which two or three others respond and join the pushers.

Another unidentified voice can be heard saying, “and the governor says there is no problem with the gasoline — look, the firefighters’ rescue truck without gasoline!”

According to Espacio Público, an NGO that operates in Venezuela, officials with the socialist regime’s Scientific, Penal, and Criminal Investigations Body (CICPC) raided Pacheco’s home Monday and arrested him. He is reportedly facing “three or four charges, among them ‘terrorism’ and ‘incitement to hate.'”

Dictator Nicolás Maduro, having lost control of the National Assembly in the nation’s last democratic elections in 2015, created an illegal parallel legislature known as the “national constituents’ assembly” in 2017 to pass laws favorable to the socialists. Among the first laws passed by the body, which consisted of Maduro allies such as his son and his wife, was the Law Against Hatred and Fascism, which allows Maduro’s police to arrest anyone threatening “peaceful coexistence” with the regime. The regime has used the law with increased frequency not just against prominent dissidents, but against anyone speaking out against the regime or exposing the realities of its failures in any way.

The fuel situation in Venezuela — a nation that, prior to socialism, was used to abundant and nearly free gasoline — has deteriorated significantly in the past year. Overall oil production fell to levels unseen since 1947 this June at 374,000 barrels per day, compared to the about 1.3 million barrels per day experts believe Venezuela’s six largest oil refineries can produce. The steep decline occurred after the expropriation of PDVSA under Chávez, who replaced seasoned oil executives and engineers with socialist cronies who brought minimal talent and experience to the job.

The socialist government of the state of Táchira, the westernmost in the country and often the most aggressively anti-socialist, announced in late July that it would stop selling any gasoline at all — a shock to those in the state, who were told not that the move was necessary because of the well-documented shortages, but because of the Chinese coronavirus pandemic.

The need to fuel vehicles has made enforcing the lockdowns difficult for Maduro’s regime. Venezuelans have stood on long, tightly spaced lines for months to get minimal fuel rations, to buy food and, for the few that have steady employment, go to work. The tension on those lines has resulted in street fights and escalated violence, including at the hands of Maduro soldiers.

Maduro’s attorney general announced last week that police had arrested four soldiers and two civilians for killing Carlos Chaparro, a 47-year-old Venezuelan who was protesting the gasoline shortages when he was killed. Venezuela has seen exponential growth in police brutality in the last decade, particularly under Maduro. Police in the country killed thousands, most of them unarmed protesters, during the peak of the anti-socialist movement in 2014-2016. The violence particularly affects minors. Children as young as 11 have reported extensive torture at the hands of police. Police have shot to death at least two 14-year-olds in the past five years.

Teens also face violence when seeking to refuel. In mid-July, similar to Chaparro’s case, assailants killed an 18-year-old during a scuffle at a line for gasoline rations. The Maduro regime has not yet identified the culprits.

Sold to us as a “take that, America” joint venture between both “rebellious” nations, it’s further proof of the growing Iranian influence in what’s left of this country.

Venezuela is – as if we didn’t have enough on our plate – becoming a gateway for the Islamic Republic to the region, courtesy of a regime desperate to do away with our resources and sovereignty so long as they get to rule over our ruined nation.

Megasis (a name that, according to the people behind it, honors the fallen during the Iran-Iraq conflict that occurred in the ‘80s) opened its doors on Thursday, July 30th, in Venezuela. The face behind this venture is Issa Rezaei, a man who has ties to Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and its missile program — I suppose that having the military control food distribution is something both regimes have in common.

The narratives by the regime’s media machine, of course, have trumpeted this “triumph” as much as possible, despite its reach hindered by no longer being able to latch onto DirecTV’s infrastructure.

The creation of a “New World,” the cooperation between Iran and Venezuela, breaking the U.S. sanctions, and the White House’s “supremacy” are some of the components of the narrative expunged by our flamboyant vice president during the opening of this store.

The supermarket is located far from the more impoverished parts of the capital – in Terrazas del Avila, an area that, while belonging to the State of Miranda, is part of the Metropolitan Region of Caracas.

Fancy, clean, with high tech dystopian checkpoints for Chinese Coronavirus prevention (which don’t seem to prevent their employees from getting infected), and, most importantly, stocked, it’s almost too good to be true. The products display their price tags not in bolivars, but on the “Great Satan’s” greenbacks, the same U.S. dollars that were once illegal for us to hold and trade – for which we had to use clever wordsmithing, such as “verdes” (greens), “lechugas” (lettuces), and even “Trumps” – that are now keeping whatever is left of our economy afloat.

While the prices themselves are expressed in foreign currency, they do seem to be within range of other supermarkets in the country: $5.92 for Lacteos Los Andes’ powdered milk (a company that was seized by the regime in 2008), $2.53 for a liter of corn oil, or $2.32 for a can of Iranian tomato paste. Some of the Iranian offerings are even cheaper than our Venezuelan counterparts — but in a country where the minimum wage isn’t even $4 per month anymore, the products are out of reach for the majority.

It’s not like you can simply walk in and purchase stuff on a whim either, thanks to the regime’s authoritarian Chinese coronavirus measures. The governor of the State of Miranda, Hector Rodriguez, recently passed a new ruling that limits citizens from purchasing essential goods, only letting them do purchases on specific days of the week determined by the last number of our ID card — a nightmare from the worst years of the socialist collapse of Venezuela that has once again resurfaced.

It’s worth mentioning that the locale that this Iranian supermarket is occupying has a picturesque story of its own, tied to the ill-fated exploits of Venezuela’s socialism.

For some time, the facilities used to belong to the Colombian “Éxito” supermarket chains, and for a time, all was good. In the early days of 2010 (and at the apex of his socialist dream), the now Supreme and Eternal Commander of the Bolivarian Revolution Hugo Chávez decided to expropriate and seize Éxito’s entire chain and infrastructure to bring forth a Corporation of Socialist Markets (COMERSO), of which “Abastos Bicentenario” went onto occupying most of Éxito’s former locations.

I think you can guess what happened next — it got run to the ground, trashed, obliterated. Shortages, long lines (some even overnight), misery, and all the wondrous experiences of grocery shopping in socialism. The last time I went to one of these was to accompany my mother. The experience was — depressing, to say the least.

The failure of Abastos Bicentenario was palliated by the Maduro regime through a new business: Tiendas CLAP — a tendril in the corrupt machinery of which Alex Saab (a man in the process of being extradited to the United States who some of the regime’s diehard shills have tried to paint as a modern version of Oskar Schindler) is part of. The CLAP is Venezuela’s socialist emergency aid kit system, in which true believers in the Bolivarian Revolution are rewarded with insect-infested rice, “yellow” milk, and rotten fish flesh.

With that also run to the ground, it’s time for some Iranian “capitalism” to come to the rescue.

For a regime that expropriated companies, seized land, and persecuted private entrepreneurship in the name of Socialist “food sovereignty” to give it all away to Iran is not just baffling, but a testament to the failure of their misbegotten ideology.

The Iranian influence in our country grows – Iranian oil, military, and now food flood the country. This brand new supermarket has already been denounced as a front for money laundering — which wouldn’t be too far-fetched if true, given the rise of bodegones (stores that sell imported goods without issue), despite the regime’s U.S.-sanction related narratives stating otherwise. I personally don’t see myself visiting these facilities anytime soon – not only are they a bit far from where I live (made worse by the limited transportation options due to coronavirus’ quarantine and the severe gasoline shortages), but I would only be able to purchase anything on Mondays and Saturdays.

No halal meat for me, I guess. Time to stick to my regular off-market provider.

The court claimed that the accounts were guilty of “fake news” and forced the American company to delete them. In a company statement, Facebook said it would comply with the order to avoid risking criminal liability for employees in Brazil, but called the measure “extreme” and a “threat to freedom of expression” outside of Brazil.

The statement read:

Facebook complied with the order of blocking these accounts in Brazil by restricting the ability for the target Pages and Profiles to be seen from IP locations in Brazil. People from IP locations in Brazil were not capable of seeing these Pages and Profiles even if the targets had changed their IP location. This new legal order is extreme, posing a threat to freedom of expression outside of Brazil’s jurisdiction and conflicting with laws and jurisdictions worldwide. Given the threat of criminal liability to a local employee, at this point we see no other alternative than complying with the decision by blocking the accounts globally, while we appeal to the Supreme Court.

Last Friday, Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes also ordered Facebook to pay a 1.92-million-real ($367,000) fine for “non-compliance” with the initial order, adding that it would face additional daily fines of 100,000 reais ($19,000) if it did not remove the accounts worldwide.

De Moraes has become an unpopular figure among Bolsonaro supporters, many of whom accuse him of trying to usurp power from Bolsonaro. In May, the 51-year-old ordered raids against 29 comedians, YouTubers, and other pro-Bolsonaro journalists as part of a supposed crackdown on “fake news.”

Since Bolsonaro’s election in 2018, Facebook has repeatedly targeted him and his followers for censorship. Even before his victory, the network blacklisted accounts and pages described as his “main network of support” for supposedly violating the website’s rules related to spam.

The company confirmed that it had removed a number of allegedly fake pro-Bolsonaro accounts, which it claimed had links to his employees and two of his sons. In March, Facebook also removed a post by the president himself for stating the drug “hydroxychloroquine is working in all places” to treat the Chinese coronavirus, on the grounds that he was spreading “misinformation that could lead to physical harm.”

VERDICT: False. She was commenting on the widely-acknowledged fact that riots were hurting Democrats politically.

Former Vice President Joe Biden’s presidential campaign attempted to blame President Donald Trump for nationwide riots in a statement Thursday night after the close of the Republican National Convention.

The statement claimed: “Before tonight’s convention, one of Trump’s top advisors even expressed hope for more discord and violence in our cities in a cynical ploy to use division as a political strategy.”

The advisor in question was Kellyanne Conway, and the statement distorts her comment. (Biden himself cited Conway CNN earlier Thursday, reading her comment out of context during an interview with Anderson Cooper.)

Conway appeared on Fox and Friends and was asked to respond to the claim by former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg that the riots were happening “on Donald Trump’s watch.”

Conway replied that the riots were happening in cities and states run by Democrats, most of whom had refused help from Trump. She then quoted a “restaurateur” in Madison, Wisconsin, who evidently opposed Trump and who asked rioters whether they were trying to get Trump re-elected.

Conway then added: “He knows, full stop, and I guess Mayor Pete knows, full stop, that the more chaos and anarchy and vandalism and violence reigns, the better it is for the very clear choice on who is best on public safety and law and order.”

That is not a “hope” for violence. It is a simple observation that Democrats’ inability to stop the violence in the cities and states that they govern makes the case stronger for Trump’s re-election. Others have made similar observations.

CNN’s Don Lemon warned earlier this week that Biden had to oppose the riots vocally, because “it’s showing up in the polling. It’s showing up in focus groups. It is the only thing – it is the only thing right now that is sticking.”

Likewise, the New York Times reported Wednesday that “Chaos in Kenosha Is Already Swaying Some Voters in Wisconsin.”

Conway noted that Trump had offered help to stop the violence with federal law enforcement, and had often been refused by Democrats putting their “pride and their politics ahead of public safety.”

Biden’s claim is completely false.

The BBC is presently paid for through a so-called licence — in reality a tax on anyone who operates a television or digital device to receive live programmes from any broadcaster, or who watches BBC programming on-demand.

But, despite taking away free licences from over-75s, the number of people who actually pay the fee is falling, as the way in which people consume media is changing and the programming produced by the BBC is becoming increasingly irrelevant to the new generation.

While some Conservatives have suggested the BBC could make itself more competitive and modern by moving to a subscription-based service like new competitors Netflix and Amazon Prime, the outgoing head of the organisation, Lord Hall, believes a better approach would be to make paying for the organisation mandatory for every household.

British newspaper The Times reported the remarks of Lord Hall, the director-general whose tenure ends this week but who is clearly familiar with internal thinking on how to charge the fee in future, that a better solution to falling interest would be to make the tax impossible to avoid. Citing Germany’s household-based tax, Lord Hall suggested the annual fee could be added to other bills like local government property taxes, so those without an interest in receiving the BBC’s services wouldn’t have a way to opt-out.

Lord Hall also said it was worth looking at a system where the amount paid — presently £157.50 a year — would scale depending on how wealthy the household was.

Despite its long-held pretence of being a national broadcaster for all, the BBC has recently been struggling with public perception, juggling efforts to appeal to viewers with trying to appease minority political activists.

One of the clearest examples of this dichotomy of late is the BBC’s handling of the Last Night of the Proms, an annual festival of classical music where traditional British patriotic songs are performed to a live audience.

Apparently bowing to pressure from Black Lives Matter UK, it was reported the BBC would scrap patriotic songs from the broadcast including Rule, Britannia! and Land of Hope and Glory.

It later said the songs would be included, but performed without any words — a compromise that appears to have appeased or pleased no-one. Nevertheless, the furore around the decision has become a lightning-conductor for opinion in the United Kingdom, bringing left-wing figures out of the woodwork to express their displeasure at the kinds of people who enjoy patriotic music.

Labour MP Neil Coyle caused outrage when he called Brexit-supporters “absolute sh*tbag racist w*nkers” in relation to the row, and a BBC producer added to public concern when she compared the ordinary patriotism of Britons to the Nazi gas chambers.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson, for his part, has expressed his embarrassment over the whole affair. He said on Tuesday: “I think it’s time we stopped our cringing embarrassment about our history, about our traditions, and about our culture, and we stopped this general bought of self-recrimination and wetness.”

Host Mika Brzezinski said, “I want to ask you about the violence but also when you think of the words of Jacob Blake’s mother, you — I feel like this is what we’re lacking in the leader of the free world because somebody has to restore calm and there has to be a sense of hierarchy and leadership that we can trust, and we’re not getting it. Might it even be being stirred up?”

Glaude said, “Well, definitely. When we hear calls for law and order in the way we heard last night, without mentioning Jacob Blake, didn’t even cross Vice President Pence’s lips. We know what he’s doing, he’s appealing to white fear, white resentment, white grievance and the like, trying to mobilize those fears for his own political gain, for Trump’s political gain.”

He continued, “Let’s step back. Of course, it’s the case that we don’t want people looting, and we don’t want people burning down businesses. We understand that. But what does it mean we turn there first? Let’s turn to what is precipitating this, Mika. Why do we have to continue to ask the question about violence when we’re not asking the question about what precipitates it. Why are we concerned that we’re playing into the hands of Donald Trump in this instance when we should be asking the more fundamental question, why are police doing this? And why are we in an environment where even the hint, the misinformation around police action, can lead to the spark of protest in this instance? In other words, we need to get to the heart of the matter. It’s clear for Mike Pence and Donald Trump black people don’t fall within the sphere of their moral concern. But we have to shift the gravity of our concern as we grapple with the issue in this particular moment.”

So CNN has a fake correspondent standing in front of what he himself describes as one of “multiple locations that have been burning in Kenosha, Wisconsin, over the course of the night” and the chyron reads “Fiery But Mostly Peaceful Protests After Police Shooting.”

You think CNN is trolling us, right? You think that’s all CNN is now — a troll channel. You think that’s what that chyron is — a deliberate troll against the honesty and decency of everyday Americans. You think CNN gets its lulz that way.

Oh, no…

CNN isn’t trolling anyone.

What CNN is doing is revealing its true mindset.

That CNN chyron flashed on Wednesday. I saw it fly by on Twitter a gajillion times yesterday but assumed it was a joke, a deep fake.

You might think the only deep faker here is CNN, but that’s unfair.

CNN isn’t lying or trolling…

When you keep in mind that CNN has spent most of the last decade devoting itself to endorsing, encouraging, normalizing, and fomenting political violence against its political enemies on the right, what we have at CNN is a mob so morally broken that in their diseased minds they honestly do see what’s happening in Kenosha as “mostly peaceful.”

Stay with me here…

What I mean is, CNN is sincere in its belief that the level of violence in these Democrat-run cities, specifically Kenosha (for reasons I’ll explain below) is too peaceful, and CNN finds that unsatisfactory and unacceptable.

You see, CNN doesn’t want Kosovo in Kenosha. Fuck that. CNN wants Hiroshima. Especially in a traitorous place like Kenosha, a place that betrayed the cause and voted for Trump in 2016 — helped squeak the Orange Bad Man over the finish line in Wisconsin, which squeaked him right into the Oval Office.

See what I’m getting at here…?

When you want to see the MAGAtards burn, all the MAGAtards, when you want to see them fed into a holocaust, Kenosha is mostly peaceful — and, man, how frustrating is that?

You do know the police are not the real targets in all this, right?

You have figured out by now that the police are only under fire because they are what stands in the way of the left’s true targets — which is you and I; which is average, middle class Americans who just want to raise families, mow lawns, and live and let live.

Along with the Democrat Party and the terrorist groups who call themselves Black Lives Matter and Antifa, CNN wants us dead, wants our neighborhoods razed, our lives destroyed.

We’re in the way of the terrorist revolution and the terrorist revolutionaries are done with this pussyfooting around. Violence? That’s not violence. What you’re seeing in Kenosha isn’t peaceful. Wait till you see what violence really looks like.

So, yeah, in CNN’s malignant mind, Kenosha is “mostly peaceful,” too goddamned peaceful, way too goddamned peaceful for these goddamned MAGAtards.

Cawthorn is paralyzed.

He stood for the flag.

This made Alcindor want to lash out.

Cawthorn was paralyzed in a car accident at age 18. During his speech he said, “Instantly, my hopes and dreams were seemingly destroyed. I was given a 1% chance of surviving. But thanks to the power of prayer, a very loving community, and many skilled doctors, I made it.”

Confined to a wheelchair, he’s now running for congress in North Carolina.

His speech was unforgettably moving, one of the most memorable of the night, of the whole convention so far, even. See for yourself at the top of this page.

Partial transcript:

My accident has given me new eyes to see and new ears to hear; God protected my mind and my ability to speak, so I say to people who feel forgotten, ignored and invisible: I see you. I hear you. In times of peril, young people have stepped up and saved this country, abroad and at home. We held the line, scaled the cliffs, crossed oceans, liberated camps, and cracked codes. Yet today, political forces want to usher in the digital dark ages. A time of information without wisdom and tribalism without truth. National leaders on the left have normalized emotion-based voting and a radicalized identity politics that rejects Martin Luther King’s dream. MLK’s dream is our dream: for all Americans to be judged solely on their character. I say to Americans across the country, young and old: be a radical for freedom. Be a radical for liberty.

Good stuff.

And then it got better: with the help of two men and a walker, Cawthorn struggled to his feet and said, “And be a radical for our Republic, for which I stand; one nation, under God, with liberty and justice for all.”

Alcindor, the stupidest and most bitter person in the media not named Chris Cuomo, was deeply triggered by the moment and heard one of those racial dog whistles the dogs in our media (sorry dogs!) only ever hear.

Using her verified Twitter account — and in an effort to sound, like, smart — she vomited up this wordy hunk of bile: “Madison Cawthorn made it a point to stand, suggesting that all Americans to should stand during the pledge of allegiance & national anthem. It was a direct rebuke of actions by ppl — including black athletes who are currently sitting out games — protesting police brutality.”

He laid out the political implications as he saw them, and how different sides of the political spectrum were reacting, which he said would have implications on the November elections.

Carlson also said despite how the situation was being portrayed by the media and others, the motivating factor was class, not race.

Transcript as follows:

CARLSON: “Kill the police,” “Death to America.” That’s not Iran. It’s Wisconsin. It could have been a dozen other places in this country. The violence has been building unabated for three months now.

Every day, the mob becomes more radical. By some accounts, 30 Americans have died so far in these riots. Democrats have openly encouraged them. Republican leaders have been too fearful to stop them. Some have applauded at all.

Five days into the first Minneapolis riots in May, as the city burned live on camera before everyone, former South Carolina Governor, Nikki Haley took to Twitter to support the rioters, quote: “It’s important to understand that the death of George Floyd was personal and painful for many,” Haley wrote, ” … in order to heal, it needs to be personal and painful for everyone.”

Well, Nikki Haley’s wish came true. The riots have been personal and painful for this country, but not for Nikki Haley. She appears to be thriving.

On Monday, Haley spoke at a featured spot at the Republican National Convention, and the media hailed her as the future of conservatism. Of course, they did. They hate the Republican Party.

A party that tolerates rioting has no future in a democracy. Human beings crave order. It’s a prerequisite for life. They fear uncertainty, above all. People will trade virtually anything for relief from chaos. That’s a fact of human nature. It’s always true.

And politicians who understand that win. Rudy Giuliani got elected twice in an overwhelmingly Democratic city because he knew that underneath it all, everyone hates lawlessness — everyone.

Richard Nixon knew that, too. Nixon was not a charming man. No one ever longed to have a beer with him. Yet Nixon managed to win what is to this day the single biggest blowout in American history in the 1972 elections. How did he do that? It was simple.

Richard Nixon was for order. His opponent was for chaos. It wasn’t hard. It’s not hard now.

Yet that lesson seems lost on this generation of leaders. Our cities are burning because the people in charge have allowed them to burn.

Tonight, the White House is sending hundreds of additional National Guardsmen and military policemen to Kenosha, and that is a very good thing.

But let’s be honest, the Justice Department could have stopped all of this months ago. If Federal prosecutors had treated the organizers of BLM and Antifa the way they treated Roger Stone, our cities wouldn’t look like Kosovo tonight.

But they didn’t do that. Instead, they enforced standards selectively in direct violation of our most sacred American principle, which is equal protection under the law. They ignored that.

Across the country, prosecutors responded to politically disfavored crimes with maximum aggression, and they ignored the rest.

Just this Sunday at a Catholic Cathedral in Philadelphia, a woman was brutally assaulted in the aisle, in the middle of a service. The attack was live-streamed to the entire congregation at home in real-time.

There was no question what happened. It was on videotape. And yet the authorities in Philadelphia concluded it was not a big deal. So they’re not pressing charges. Here’s the crime they’ve decided to ignore.

[VIDEO CLIP PLAYS]

CARLSON: It’s awful, but think bigger for a moment. What is the effect on the country, on the rest of us, when authorities allow assaults like the one you just saw open threats and harassment and violence to go unpunished? What does that cause? Well, it increases tribalism for one thing. It makes us hate each other, and that’s why they’re doing it.

Our leaders want us to believe that this is all a racial conflict. They’re always telling us it is, but they’re lying. It is not a racial conflict.

At its deepest level, the chaos they have unleashed has very little to do with race. Most Americans are not bigots. Unlike CNN, they are not fixated on skin color. They don’t really care — most of them.

What you’re watching is more sinister than that. What you’re watching is an effort by the academic left funded by big business to crush the last remaining resistance to their control of the country, and that resistance is an independent American middle class. That’s who they really hate.

Discussing Mark and Patricia McCloskey, Henderson said, “Think about what that couple did. They drew guns on people outside their home on a sidewalk because they were Black. I mean, that’s exactly what happened in that instance, and that is the message, I think, that Donald Trump wants to deliver to particularly white people — that he is the one standing between the lawlessness of Black and brown people. And he is the one that can essentially help white Americans maintain their status. He gets black people to sort of vouch for him and say that he’s not a racist, and, in fact, say that America’s not even really a racist country. So, listen, this could very well work because I think, you know, there is some anxiety among white Americans about the changing demographics of this country. There is some anxiety about sharing power with different groups in this country.”

She continued, “You have Donald Trump saying that — to white America, you won’t have to share that power in his America. So I think, listen, he has been able to reinvent himself to white audiences throughout his career, particularly white evangelicals, who see him in some ways as a messianic kind of figure,” she said. “There are white Americans who very much want to believe in Donald Trump, so they could very well believe in this version of Donald Trump that is presented here that is patently false and patently at odds with the Donald Trump we know and have seen over these last many years.”

Henderson added, “You saw all those Black men that are featured. There are no women. Black women, right? We talk about him going after women. He’s really just going after white women. I don’t think a single Black woman has stood live in the podium area at all. Maybe that will happen at some other point. But they are very, very consistently and strategically going after Black men and talking about some of the things that Joe Biden has said and done because there is a history of black men voting for Donald Trump, 13% did so in 2016. So it is that, and it is also this sort of indirect appeal to white moderates as well who want to feel comfortable voting for a man who is someone who is a racial flame thrower and likes to race bait.”

The notion, which has been deemed “mostly false” by left-leaning PolitiFact, is based on comments made by Trump promoting the idea of studying the use of disinfectants in the human body to mitigate the threat from the COVID-19 virus.

The comments, according to the White House, were taken out of context, and Trump never actually mention “bleach” in his remarks.

Cooper’s remarks led to a back-and-forth with CNN contributor David Urban.

Blitzer said, “I want to bring in Kaitlan Collins into this conversation. Kaitlan, you’re there at Fort McHenry. It’s so sad and potentially dangerous to see a few hundred people who have gathered there, supporters of the president. They’re very close together. They’re not wearing masks, as Dana pointed out— in the midst of this very deadly coronavirus pandemic. And by all accounts, I’m told, but maybe you have more information, that most of these people were not tested for coronavirus before they were allowed to come into this setting. And we know there’s going to be a much bigger crowd tomorrow on the South Lawn of the White House when the president makes his presentation.”

Collins said, “We’re expecting it to actually be ten times the size tomorrow night. Tonight, we’ve seen about 135 chairs before, and that’s how many we counted were here. They seemed to all be filled. And what’s notable is that the attendees are sitting pretty close to one another. They’re not wearing masks. We spoke to at least four of them who had not been tested to coronavirus before coming to this event, Wolf, and it’s unclear if some of them potentially were. We saw that was the case last night, which caused some confusion. The people seated around the president in the Rose Garden had been tested, according to the first lady’s office, but several of the rows back, most of the attendees last night had not been tested.”

“So it’s not clear if that’s what the case is here,” she continued. “What you just saw after the vice president ended his speech, which I’m not sure if you saw, but what we were watching is the president, and the first lady were down walking face-to-face, interacting with self of the audience members, many of whom are not wearing masks tonight, Wolf. It was striking to see how closely they were interacting, given we’re not convinced every single person in the audience has been tested tonight. We were tested before we came in. Our photographers, producers were tested. It’s not clear audience members were. We spoke to at least four of them who had not been. It was really striking to be here not only at this outdoor venue. You are seeing probably a bigger crowd than what many Americans have seen over the last several months, but also for the president and the first lady to come down from the stage and to be interacting with those other audience members not wearing masks tonight, Wolf.”

Blitzer said, “Yeah, I say begun, it looked very dangerous, very risky to me. There were plenty of older people there. I’m sure a lot of the people had underlying health issues that they need to worry about, but they were there, and they weren’t wearing masks.”

Tapper said, “Speaking of whitewashing, as I believe the vice president did to a large degree about their record when it comes to the coronavirus pandemic, again, the U.S. with less than 5% of the world’s population has more than 20% of the world’s deaths according to official numbers. Speaking of whitewashing, they talked about the violence in the streets, including in Kenosha, Vice President Pence did. There was no specific mention of the fact that the 17-year-old who has been accused of murdering two — we believe they were protestors is according to his social media accounts a Trump supporter.”

He added, “Now, again, that does not mean that President Trump is responsible at all for that violence, but the way that the vice president portrayed it, the violence was out of control liberals, leftists, progressives, and Vice President Biden, Joe Biden, isn’t going to do anything about it. He said that Biden didn’t say one word about the violence and chaos engulfing cities across the country. Although, he added last week because earlier today Joe Biden did condemn the violence. But no mention at all about the apparently far-right individual in Kenosha who murdered two people.”

Biden launched his campaign by citing the false claim that President Donald Trump had called the neo-Nazis and white supremacists who rioted in Charlottesville, Virginia, in August 2017 “very fine people.”

In fact, President Trump had said they should be “condemned totally.” He used the term “very fine people” to refer to non-violent protesters, left and right, peacefully expressing their views both for and against the removal of a local statue of Confederate general Robert E. Lee.

Biden repeated the lie in his speech last Thursday at the Democratic National Convention.

Brewer — a Democrat — responded at the RNC, making an impassioned appeal to black Americans to support Trump based on his policies and record:

We are not as divided as our politics suggest. At some point, for the sake of our children, the policies must take priority over the personalities. So because you have an issue with President Trump’s tone, you’re going to allow Biden/Harris to deny our underserved black and brown children school choice? Are we so offended by the President’s campaign slogan, “Make America Great Again,” that we are going to ignore that Joe Biden and Kamala Harris have collectively been responsible for locking up countless black men for non-violent crimes? Are you going to allow the media to lie to you, by falsely claiming that he said there were “very fine” white supremacists in Charlottesville — He didn’t say that! It’s a lie! — and ignore the so-called Black Lives Matter organization that openly — on their website — call for the destruction of the nuclear family?

Brewer, a former safety who played for four NFL teams, also appeared on Breitbart News Sunday last weekend.

He is a member of the Black Voices for Trump coalition, and also works as a minister to prisoners through President Trump’s First Step Act, which helps deserving prisoners reduce their sentences.

Toward the end of his speech, Brewer declared: “Republicans are the party that freed the slaves, and The Party that put the first black men and women in Congress. It’s the Party of Frederick Douglass and Abraham Lincoln – and now, Tim Scott and Donald Trump.”

The original story reported on Bolt’s positive test result and after he had been tested for COVID-19. The story now includes an update reading, “A previous version of this article included an incorrect photo on some platforms due to a technical problem. The photo depicted actor Kevin Hart. It has been replaced with a photo of Usain Bolt.”

The gold medal-winning sprinter celebrated his 34th birthday last week with a big bash in Jamaica at which few revelers wore masks. Bolt then decided to get tested for the coronavirus thinking maybe the exposure might have been problematic. The tests came back positive.

“Just to be safe I quarantined myself and just taking it easy,” Bolt said in a video posted to social media, adding, “Stay safe my ppl.”

Bolt says he is asymptomatic and feels fine. Jamaica has experienced a glut of positive COVID tests, so much so that Jamaican Prime Minister Andrew Holness put his re-election campaign on hold, curtailing meet-and-greet events and rallies.

The report listed 1,006,000 new claims for the week ending Aug. 22, a decrease of 98,000 from the previous week. It listed the unemployment rate at 9.9 percent.

Thursday’s report also revised down last week’s claims by 2,000 filings.

Most economists expected about one million new claims.

The department said there are 14.5 million continuing claims, which lag initial claims by a week.

The department reported 1.1 million new claims last week, which was higher than experts had predicted. The week before, new claims dipped below one million for the first time since March.

The unemployment report came about a half hour before Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell was scheduled to deliver a speech outlining a critical plan to stimulate the economy amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

Thursday’s jobless numbers come on the same day as the Commerce Department’s revised estimate showing that the U.S. economy plunged by nearly 32 percent in the second quarter of 2020 — the steepest quarterly decline in history.

The loss, however, wasn’t as bad as the department reported a month ago in its initial estimate.

The decline in the April-July period was 31.7 percent, the department said in its second estimate. The first estimate last month showed a decline of 33 percent for the quarter.

The department said the new estimate is based on “more complete” data.

“With the second estimate, private inventory investment and personal consumption expenditures decreased less than previously estimated,” it said.

The domestic economy — measured by gross domestic product (GDP) — fell by 5 percent over the first quarter, before the full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.

“[The crisis] led to rapid shifts in activity, as businesses and schools continued remote work and consumers and businesses canceled, restricted, or redirected their spending,” the Commerce Department said. “The full economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic cannot be quantified in the GDP estimate for the second quarter of 2020 because the impacts are generally embedded in source data and cannot be separately identified.”

Thursday’s report said second-quarter losses were partly offset by an increase in federal government spending, mostly from the CARES Act.

“Under Obama-Biden, radical environmentalists were allowed to kill the forests,” Dane said. “Wildfire after wildfire shows the consequences. Managed forests—the kind my people work in — are healthy forests.”

“Under President Trump, we’ve seen a new recognition of the value of forest management in reducing wildfires,” Dane said. “And we’ve seen new support for our way of life—where a strong back and a strong work ethic can build a strong middle class.”

“We want to build families where we’re raised and stand by communities that have stood by us,” Dane said. “We want that way of life available for the next generation, and we want our forests there too.”

“President Trump, thank you for helping us do just that,” Dane said.

As Breitbart News reported, Trump and his Department of Interior and related agencies have been working to implement forest management practices that remove fuel for fires, including dead vegetation and thick tree groves. But environmentalists and the courts have resisted the effort:

The Trump administration has been working to prevent the deadly wildfires that have plagued the West by putting in place forest management practices, including thinning forests in Oregon to reduce fire fuel. But environmental activists have taken the matter to court and found judges in the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit who ruled the United States Forest Service put the plan in place “without assessing its environmental impact.”

Courthouse News reported on the legal battle:

In 2018, several conservation groups sued the agency over plans to sell timber harvested from about 12,000 acres of public land, including roughly 4,000 acres of old-growth conifers in Mt. Hood National Forest. The Forest Service dubbed it the Crystal Clear Restoration Project, saying the tree-thinning would reduce wildfire risk. But Cascade Wildlands, Bark, and Oregon Wild argued that mature tree removal may not actually help with fire suppression, pointing to articles from The Open Forest Science Journal and Forest Ecology and Management, as well as other expert sources to support their claims.

“Logging has been a part of the Great American Story from the beginning, Dane said. “In fact, if you go to the U.S. Capitol Rotunda and look up, you can see loggers on one of the panels—New England settlers carving out a new world from the wilderness.”

CNBC reports that according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, Jeff Bezos has become the first person to cross the $200 billion threshold after seeing his net worth grow to $202 billion on Wednesday. Bezos’ personal wealth is largely based on Amazon stock which has increased massively in value in recent years along with eh company’s share price.

In 2018, Bezos became the richest man in modern history when his personal wealth hit $150 billion, now valued at $202 billion he is $78 billion richer than Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, the world’s second-richest man.

Amazon shares hit a record high in April due to massive consumer demand during the coronavirus pandemic as many turned to Amazon for essential deliveries including groceries and medical protective gear such as masks and hand sanitizer. The surge in demand saw Amazon’s revenue top $88.9 billion in its second quarter, the firm also reported better-than-expected profits despite spending billions of dollars on coronavirus-linked investments.

In May, Breitbart News reported that a study from the business analysis firm Comparisun stated that Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos was likely to become the world’s first trillionaire after seeing his net worth grow on an average of 34 percent over the last five years.

Comparisun’s projections show that Bezos could reach trillionaire status by 2026 based on taking Bezos’ average percentage of yearly growth over the past five years and applying it to future years. Following Bezos, the next several likely trillionaires are Chinese tycoons, including Jack Ma, CEO of Alibaba.

A newly released document reveals that Google’s own engineers believe that the company “confuses users” and even some employees about privacy on the company’s platforms.

Business Insider reports that new information in a lawsuit relating to Google’s data collection and location-tracking practices include statements from the company’s own engineers who believe that the company confuses both users and some employees on the topic of privacy.

The office of Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich sued Google in May, alleging that the company deceived users about the location tracking data that it collects, continuing to track users even after they opted out of location tracking in privacy settings.

A version of the lawsuit which was made public on Friday included multiple statements from Google employees acknowledging the poor design choices of Google’s privacy settings which made it difficult for users to easily opt-out of location tracking.

One employee stated in the court documents that the Google privacy settings user interface “feels like it is designed to make things possible, yet difficult enough that people won’t figure it out.” Another said that it was “Definitely confusing from a user point of view if we need googlers [to] explain it to us.”

A Google spokesperson told the Arizona Mirror: “Privacy controls have long been built into our services and our teams work continuously to discuss and improve them. In the case of location information, we’ve heard feedback, and have worked hard to improve our privacy controls. In fact, even these cherry picked published extracts state clearly that the team’s goal was to ‘Reduce confusion around Location History Settings.'”

The attorney general’s office alleges that “even top-level Google employees do not understand under what conditions Google collects location data.”

1049,http://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/08/27/donald-trumps-visa-curbs-get-americans-ski-resort-jobs/,2020-08-27T00:00:00,breitbart,"President Donald Trump’s June 22 curbs on visa workers is forcing reluctant ski resorts to hire Americans in place of foreign workers, according to a report in the Colorado Sun.

Jason Blevins at the Colorado Sun reported that the ski resorts are reluctantly filling their jobs with young Americans instead of the J-1 and H-2B visa workers, which were blocked by Trump:

“Trying to fill positions without an international pool of applicants is a little concerning, but we think we can replace them domestically,” said Jim Laing, the head of human resources for Aspen Skiing Co., which typically hires about 400 J-1 exchange visa workers every season. “Our applications from college kids are up pretty significantly over prior years. We are targeting college-age applicants, but they seem to be targeting us as well. That’s a bright light in this mess.” … “We have already ramped up winter season recruiting efforts and have been pleased with the results so far,” said Vail Resorts spokesman Ryan Huff. “We have found interest among students who have more flexibility now due to online learning or deferring college attendance for a year. And our employees from prior seasons are also showing enthusiasm to return.”

The successful hiring, however, is a problem for the business groups that are asking a judge to block Trump’s job-saving, wage-generating executive order. A version of the lawsuit, filed July 17, says:

The [J-1] summer work/travel program has a cap of 109,000 vias per year. Employers who seek to hire summer students in the program, as well as employers seeking to hire interns and trainees, must certify that in doing so they “will not diplace U.S. workers at worksite where they will replace program participants.” … There ceritfication requirements ensure that it is legally and practically impossible … for the J exchange programs to be responsible for the “particularly high” unemployment rates for”young Americans, who compete with certain J non-immigrant visa applicants.”

The lawsuit is getting a hearing before a D.C. judge on August 27.

In June, Blevins reported the ski industry’s claims that their future was threatened by Trump’s popular executive order barring the entry of foreign workers hired via the J-1, H-1B, and L-1 labor pipelines.

“If you are an HR director at a ski area, you are panicking right now,” Dave Byrd, the policy director for the 400-plus member National Ski Areas Association told Blevins in June, stating, “J-1s are not taking American jobs. We have tapped every single person in local communities who would be interested in taking short-term, temporary jobs. Without these workers, we are losing economic activity.”

Fast-forward to August, and Blevins reported on one American coed, Mia Conley, who expected to attend Colorado State University this Fall:

But the graduate of Eagle Valley High School deferred her acceptance in July, after finding out all but one of her classes were going to be online. She’s decided to get a job near home and attend Colorado Mountain College to complete college credits at a fraction of the cost. “I thought about taking a gap year all through high school. It’s always been in the back of my mind, but I wasn’t going to do it but now I have the opportunity,” the avid skier said. “Maybe I’ll travel. Do some school wherever there’s Wi-Fi. Absolutely I’ll do some skiing. I’m taking this whole thing as a blessing.”

Many Fortune 500 companies import visa workers via the J-1, H-1B, L-1, OPT, CPT, TN, H-2B, H-2A, and other visa programs. The programs keep roughly 2 million foreign contract-workers in an expanding variety of U.S. jobs, so minimizing CEOs’ concerns about workforce turnover, domestic technology theft, worker quality, workplace civil-rights obligations, and escalating pay competition, which CEOs stigmatize as “poaching”:

“To claim that ski resorts can’t find Americans to work is laughable,” especially because 30 million Americans are jobless, said Mark Krikorian, director of the Center for Immigration Studies. The visa programs, he said:

Seem harmless — “It’s only a few people!” “What the deal?” — but, like a drug, the companies become dependent on them, and they build their business around these models, so when there is an interruption, they demanded more of the drug. The solution is to not create that dependency.

But the Colorado Sun article shows again that executives can rebuild their American labor supply, Krikorian said.

Employers can actually try to hire Americans, including students and old people, for part-time work, he said. They can work with local schools and colleges to adjust schedules, and they can create staffing companies to help 20-something Americans move through several seasonal jobs around the nation, he said.

“Seasonal jobs might not be attractive for middle-aged men with kids and mortgages — but for young people who don’t have mortgages and families, who are still figuring out what they want to do, they could be very attractive,” he said.

These seasonal jobs are also good for society because they help teenagers become responsible adults, he said:

It is good for them to have the opportunity to earn money … but one of the most important things you need to learn as a youth is how to be an employee — not just the job skills, but how to work with the public, how to show up on time, and how not to lash out a crappy supervisor. If you’re not working when you are young, you miss a chance to acquire those skills.

Donald Trump's labor & immigration promises for a 2nd term are vague but useful.

They are also better for ordinary Americans than Joe Biden's business-backed, open-ended inflow of wage-cutting & rent-raising blue-collar workers & college-graduates. https://t.co/OmE4tRPf4T — Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) August 26, 2020

The industry’s preference for compliant, easy-to-manage, visa workers was outlined in a July 10 podcast by The Storm Skiing Journal. Byrd, who also serves as the chief advocated for the National Ski Areas Association, told the journal:

We’re using summer work travel [workers]. And what that means is, these are college students. So, for the southern hemisphere, because their summer break in college aligns with our winter ski seasons, they’re coming up to the U.S. to see how American businesses operate. … There’s also an intern component, separate and apart from summer work travel [program]. That intern is a separate visa under the J-1 [program]. Those are specifically for college students who are going towards a career in hospitality in some fashion, and so they take internee positions. Deer Valley, for example, utilizes them very successfully. And it’s a wonderful program. If you’re in a hospitality major or lodging type of study program down in New Zealand or South Africa, South America, wherever, these internee programs in the U.S., because of our American business models, are so well-honed there, those are very great positions to get. … So, the resorts work with sponsoring agencies here in the U.S., who handle a lot of the recruiting, a lot of the regulatory process through the State Department. There are interviews. There are background checks. There’s fingerprinting. They have to — as I mentioned — interview down at the embassies where they’re coming from. If they’re coming from, say, Romania or Poland, they’re going to embassies over there. They provide their own travel [costs], but we do pay them the same wage-rate as American workers. The J-1s work with the ski areas is to find housing in the local community.

The ski groups are working with legislators to persuade the White House to lift the June 22 curbs, he said.

We’re going to be working with the administration, with members of Congress, both Republicans and Democrats, to help us advocate to the White House, to the State Department, to the Department of Labor, and Homeland Security. We’re going to make a very strong economic argument, seeking a modification of the proclamation and within the proclamation itself … Specifically, we need both J-1s and H-2Bs, even at a time of higher unemployment because of COVID, [so we need] a modification that allows these people to be in-country by December 1. If you think about it, with so many ski areas impacted in March by the early closures, as an industry, we lost more than $2 billion for the 2020 year because of that early closure, missing out on Spring Break and Easter. We can’t have that happen again for our winter and holiday season. I would estimate in that period of time between mid-December in the first week of January, you know it’s a three-to-four week window, we make upwards of 20 to 25 percent of our revenue of the entire season during that window, and we have to be staffed appropriately.

Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti said Wednesday evening that he was sticking with his version of the “Green New Deal” for the city despite electricity blackouts elsewhere in the state due to the inadequacy of solar and wind power at peak demand.

Earlier this year, Garcetti declared that L.A. would adopt a “Green New Deal” by abandoning plans to rebuild three natural gas plants, turning to solar and wind power instead. Officials doubted whether the city would have enough electricity under Garcetti’s plan to keep the lights on, and members of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 18 — the union representing L.A. Department of Water and Power employees — protested vehemently against Garcetti’s proposal.

Breitbart News asked Garcetti whether he was reconsidering his plan, given last week’s admission by Gov. Gavin Newsom that the state needed to “sober up” about the shortfalls of solar and wind power as the state moved toward renewable energy.

“No,” Garcetti said, adding: “We have to ‘sober up,’ but that doesn’t mean ‘let up.” He said he was confident that the city’s solar and wind power projects would need L.A.’s needs because they were also building battery storage capacity. And he said that the recent wildfires across the state proved the need to continue efforts to reduce the impacts of climate change.

Last August, opponents of Garcetti’s “Green New Deal” pushed a Republican to victory in a special election for city council.

Republican John Lee defeated Democrat Loraine Lundquist, who backed Garcetti’s Green New Deal enthusiastically.

“The short answer is very, very well,” Brady said when asked how recovery efforts in Texas were doing. “Phase 1 and Phase 2 went really well.”

Brady also noted the hospitalization numbers, which he said have dropped significantly. “We’ve bent the curve on the number of hospitalizations.”

“If this were a fight, a boxing match, between Joe Biden and Donald Trump about who can recover this economy and get people back their jobs, this would be a first-round knockout for President Trump,” Brady said, noting President Trump’s accomplishments on tax reform and claiming Joe Biden and former President Barack Obama’s economic recovery was the “slowest in our lifetime.”

“Growth was slow, paychecks were flat for all eight years,” Brady continued. “Every month we saw another U.S. company move their jobs in manufacturing overseas. And when Joe Biden was leaving office, most Americans thought they were still in a recession. President Trump changed all of that.”

“Democrats, unfortunately, I think in Congress, what I’ve seen is Nancy Pelosi sabotaging this recovery, the refusal to extend our paycheck protection program for small businesses and helping our workers reconnect with their jobs,” Brady said, adding that Republicans want to make sure those that are unemployed now are not “permanently unemployed.”

Brady went on to say that Democrats are not “interested” in recovering America’s economy under President Trump’s leadership.

“[Democrats] are not interested, unfortunately, in getting this economy back, up to strength,” Brady said. “Look, we’ve already passed the largest emergency aid package in American history through those first four bills. What we need now is not trillions more, just good, smart economic policy made a part of that.”

1052,http://www.breitbart.com/economy/2020/08/26/dhs-sets-1-year-delay-of-work-permits-to-asylum-migrants/,2020-08-26T00:00:00,breitbart,"President Donald Trump’s Department of Homeland Security has begun implementing a regulation that blocks and delays the award of work permits to migrants who ask for asylum.

The August 25 rule says migrants who ask for asylum at the border now must wait a year to get work permits. The rule also denies work permits to migrants who apply for asylum after they are caught sneaking across the border by border officers, who have committed felonies or domestic violence in the United States, or who have been caught driving while drunk or high.

Elite-backed pro-migration groups have filed a lawsuit against the rule, which aids blue-collar Americans.

The rule was drafted after department officials discovered that many migrants were getting work permits in just 30 days, or 180 days, once they were caught and quickly released at the border — even though their asylum pleas would not be heard in court for more than a year.

The promise of near-immediate work permits encouraged hundreds of thousands of economic migrants to make the expensive journey to the United States because it allowed them to quickly get jobs and repay their travel debts to the cartel-affiliated coyotes. The legal jobs also allow the hard-working migrants to hire coyotes to place their children into the “Unaccompanied Alien Children” pipeline for delivery to their residencies in the United States.

In 2019, 439,000 asylum-seeking migrants got new or renewed work permits, said Jessica Vaughan, policy director at the Center for Immigration Studies.

“This rule is going back to a tried-and-true policy regarding asylum seekers,” said she said.

President Bill Clinton’s administration set the 180-day rule only to aid the few asylum seekers who were released when their asylum claims could not be quickly processed, she said. “The Clinton administration did not want to offer [quick] work permits as an incentive to make asylum claims,” she said.

But the huge rush of migrants to the border in 2018 and 2019 overwhelmed detention spaces, forcing the release of many migrants, she said. “Trump is reinstating a [no-incentive] principle that was adopted by the Clinton administration and was widely accepted as a sensible reform at the time.”

The new rule was implemented following a routine two-month delay after it was first published in June. The rule says:

The proposed amendments would make asylum applicants eligible to apply for employment authorization 365 calendar days from the date their asylum application is received. The 365-day period was based on an average of the current processing times for asylum applications which can range anywhere from 6 months to over 2 years

Elite-backed pro-migration groups are suing to block Trump’s rule, which helps American blue-collars get decent jobs at decent wages.

The board members of the two groups, the International Refugee Assistance Project and the Asylum Seeker Advocacy Project, include former top officials in President Barack Obama’s administration, investment bankers, and prestigious lawyers.

CBS reported on one of the groups’ plaintiffs, who is a Central American migrant now living in Ohio:

As a single mother of two young children, including her nine-month-old U.S. citizen daughter, W.L. worries about her ability to support her family, particularly in the midst of a pandemic. The asylum-seeking mother, who says she was a victim of sexual violence in her native Guatemala, does not have a permit to work legally in the U.S., and under a new Trump administration rule taking effect Tuesday, she will not be able to apply for one for the next seven months. “We need work permits to cover our basic necessities, especially for our children,” W.L., who asked for her initials to be used rather than her full name, told CBS News in Spanish.

Wealthy people gain economically and politically from the continued inflow of the legal and illegal workers, who also serve them as consumers and renters, and by expanding divisive diversity throughout Americans’ society.

In contrast, the beneficiaries of Trump’s DHS rule include tens of millions of blue-collar Americans who have faced growing job competition and wage loss from many millions of legal and illegal migrants. The migrants have also helped drive up Americans’ housing prices, further disadvantaging white, black, and brown blue-collar families and their children.

The elites fund the pro-migration lawsuits because it “strikes their sense of social justice and their desire to help less-privileged people around the world, and because it feeds into the fantasy of what [they think] the U.S. asylum system is supposed to be doing,” said Vaughan. She continued:

They’re so insulated from reality that they don’t understand the effects this has on Americans and legal immigrants. They see these asylum seekers as willing workers who can take service jobs and factory jobs and think there will be no consequences for Americans. They see this as a free lunch with no downsides — but they don’t have to compete with [the asylum seekers for jobs, their [grown] children don’t have to compete with them for jobs….. their children are not in the same schools.

Moreover, Vaughan added, the work permit rules are needed to help legitimate asylum seekers: “This is necessary to avoid abuse of our asylum system, and the beneficiaries will be legitimate asylum seekers .. .who will not have to wait long to have their claims heard.”

Trump has been “unstoppable” in trying to block the flow of migrants across the U.S. border, admitted Miles Taylor, a former DHS official who is organizing former officials to oppose Trump’s reelection. During an August 25 podcast report in theDailyBeast.com, Taylor said:

I’d actually just become the Deputy Chief of Staff [in 2018] and so before that I’ve been [Chief of Staff] John Kelly’s national security adviser, and so had been doing nothing immigration and was glad not to be doing immigration, because everyone who was doing immigration was just suffering daily at the President’s unstoppable obsession with building the wall and blocking caravans.

Trump’s border security policy helped push up wages for blue-collar Americans at a faster rate than white-collar wages. However, it still leaves millions of illegal migrants in the United States.

Trump’ focus on immigration makes sense, in part, because it is very popular and he can expand his vote total by expanding the turnout of non-college voters — including working-class blacks — in battleground states:

It's clear where Trump sees opportunity to offset erosion in support since '16: amping up turnout among his base – non-college whites. And by my math, non-college whites were a disproportionate share of '16 *non-voters* in all '20 battlegrounds except AZ and TX. pic.twitter.com/1JB3uDPi2l — Dave Wasserman (@Redistrict) August 26, 2020

Since June 2020, Trump also has begun to trim the huge inflow of white-collar visa workers who take jobs from huge numbers of U.S. college graduates. That is a late and incomplete response to his March 2016 promise: “I will end forever the use of the H-1B as a cheap labor program and institute an absolute requirement to hire American workers first for every visa and immigration program. No exceptions.”

In contrast, Biden’s 2020 campaign is promising a nationwide amnesty for illegal immigrants, rapid increases in legal immigration, and a dramatic jump in refugee settlement. Biden also promises a temporary halt to border enforcement, the inflow of more visa workers, plus a green card giveaway to many temporary visa workers who already have taken jobs from American graduates.

Each year, roughly four million Americans turn 18 and begin looking for jobs and wages.

But the federal government helps CEO s and investors by inflating the labor supply with roughly one million new legal immigrants, and by allowing companies to keep roughly two million blue-collar and white-collar visas workers in jobs needed by Americans.

The labor force inflation is worsened by the resident population of at least eight million illegal migrant workers, and by the arrival of many new illegal migrants and so-called “overstay” people who do not leave the United States when their visas expire.",DHS Sets 1-Year Delay of Work Permits to Asylum Migrants,fake

According to Stoppelman, Google doesn’t like to compete on a level playing field because, “when they tried to, they were losing.”

Appearing on a recent episode of The Vergecast, Jeremy Stoppelman the CEO of the popular restaurant and business review app Yelp discussed antitrust issues surrounding major tech firms such as Amazon, Apple, and Google.

SToppelman has been a vocal critic of Google for years, noting the company’s dominance of areas such as maps, local search, and reviews. Stoppelman discussed his antitrust investigation of Google on the podcast stating: “I’ve been working on it for over a decade and it’s great to see that more people have jumped on board. When we started out criticizing Google and highlighting some of their abuses, we got — especially from Silicon Valley — so many eye rolls.”

During the podcast, Verge reporter Nilay Patel asked Stoppelman if he believes that Google should not be allowed TO enter local search or be allowed to enter a category where they have a large enough dataset to deliver results immediately. Stoppelman discussed how he believes Google has acted in an anti-competitive way towards his company, stating:

Certainly they can compete, but they should compete on a level playing field. And in fact, when they tried to, they were losing. There are conversations that are now public that were over email, where they’re like, “Oh yeah, Yelp is coming up so much. We have to do something. Okay. Whenever Yelp is going to show high-end results, we should trigger our map box and make sure that our results are above it.” They literally had an “if” statement in their code that said, “If Yelp, then show us our stuff above it.” If you occupy a monopoly position, you should not be able to basically jam everybody off the page just because you want that revenue to yourself. You built up this trust with consumers, they all learned to rely on you. You bought up all the search box market share so anyone that types in a search — whether it’s Safari or Firefox — is going straight to your site and then you’re burying objectively better content. I’m sorry, that’s not playing the game fairly.

When asked how he believes that the online search marketplace could be made more equal, Stoppelman stated:

I think you ideally make it so that Google can’t take all of the lucrative areas that it doesn’t currently occupy, and then jam a product into that space and then absorb all of the market share. Look at what they did at travel search. They went and they bought a critical component of travel search, which is this company, ITA, that had all of the data on where the flights are coming and going and how much they cost and so forth that all of the major players relied on. And they did a little, “Oh yeah, we’re definitely not going to use it for nefarious purposes.” And now if you do a travel search or airline search, all of a sudden, instead of seeing all the major players for airline search, you’re getting a Google box, which doesn’t necessarily cover all the best flights, all the best prices — there’s been some studies on that. I think that’s a real problem.

One venture capitalist commented, “These closed gardens feel like extortion. You need to pay to survive. It harkens to Microsoft and the Department of Justice investigation, and AT&T before that. With Apple and Google, it comes down to what is the ‘right’ take for the platforms? Thirty percent? 10%?”

In an article published by MarketWatch titled “Will videogames be the Achilles heel for Apple, Google in antitrust investigations?”Jon Swartz writes that gaming may be the secret weakness of tech giants such as Apple and Google in antitrust lawsuits. Swartz notes that as gaming grows more important for many Americans during the pandemic, it has highlighted the power that Google and Apple have over the billion-dollar industry.

Swartz writes:

Epic Games Inc.’s lawsuits against the online stores of Apple Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google for punitive business practices associated with 30% fees could for the first time shine the anticompetitive light on so-called network-effects platforms that exhibit the deep reservoirs of power that tech’s largest companies wield, say gaming developers and experts in the field.

James Currier, managing partner at NFX, a Silicon-Valley-based venture capital firm, told MarketWatch: “This is an inflection point, and the start of a long-running debate on how these platforms push us right to the edge of what we are willing to pay.” Currier added: “These closed gardens feel like extortion. You need to pay to survive. It harkens to Microsoft and the Department of Justice investigation [in the 1990s], and AT&T before that. With Apple and Google, it comes down to what is the ‘right’ take for the platforms? Thirty percent? 10%?”

Adam Landis, chief executive of AdLibertas Inc., a company that helps mobile developers make money from apps, commented: “Ultimately the app developers are completely at the whim of the distribution store owners — it’s fairly often an app will be banned temporarily with no recourse. When customers ask us ‘do [we] have to pay the 30% Apple tax?’ our counsel is that the developer simply bite the bullet or devise an around-the-horn approach — Spotify is the best example of this.” Spotify filed a complaint against Apple with the European Commission last year.

Nvidia Corp. CEO Jensen Huang commented during an earnings call on Wednesday:

The gaming industry, with all that’s happening around the world, and it’s really unfortunate, but it’s made gaming the largest entertainment medium in the world. The thing that people haven’t realized about videogames is that it’s not just a game itself anymore. You’re spending time with your friends. You’re using it to create, to realize your imaginations. People are using it for broadcast, for sharing ideas and techniques with other people, and then of course it’s just an incredibly fun way to spend time.

Swartz concludes:

With gaming industry profits at record levels, the decision on how they’re doled out has never been more important. Apple and Google, for example, are in danger of losing one of their most profitable titles, “Fortnite,” as they face greater antitrust scrutiny from legislators. (“Fortnite” hauled in $1 billion in player spending on Apple iOS devices through mid-May, based on estimates from mobile-app research company Sensor Tower, suggesting Apple received hundreds of millions of dollars from the hit videogame.)

Kevin Brady (R-TX) slammed House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and Democratic leadership for ignoring small business amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.

According to Brady, small business and unemployed workers are “ignored” for Congress to focus on a “fake post office crisis” that Democrats have been pushing as they call for country-wide mail-in voting.

“Larry Kudlow and the president will tell you that our work’s not done,” Brady said of the economy. “We believe we need another round of PPP for our small businesses. We need more incentives to help the industries that aren’t going to recover quickly. They’re going to need help rehiring and keeping workers on the payroll as well. And I think we need redesign of unemployment so we can help reconnect workers. We just want to make sure that those who are temporarily unemployed aren’t permanently unemployed, and I think that’s the key message here.”

He added, “I talked to Larry Kudlow a great deal about what this economy needs to recover. And to answer to your question, I sure hope so. You know, I was really disappointed that our small businesses, our unemployed workers, were just ignored for Congress to rush back for a fake post office crisis that didn’t exist. Meanwhile, look, I will tell you, our small businesses are struggling. They need help in a major way, and they’re just being ignored.”

“Hold on,” host Stephanie Ruhle interrupted. “Excuse me, congressman, congressman, a fake. … Sir, a fake postal crisis?”

“Absolutely,” Brady replied.

“As far as the post office is working as they’ve made it clear, they can easily handle the mail-in balloting process,” he continued. “They have $14 billion in the bank, are solvent through next year. They are going through a bipartisan reorganization that, by the way, has some glitches and needs to be addressed. But, yeah, I find it offensive that our small businesses and unemployed workers … basically have been ignored by Speaker Pelosi while we go rushing back to Washington for the post office. I’ll just tell you, I think … we need real help now. And I would urge the speaker to sit down and Secretary Mnuchin, Leader McConnell, the president. Let’s find some common ground here.”

Wolf recently helped cut many exemptions through Trump’s June 22 curbs on the Fortune 500’s policy of hiring visa workers, said Kevin Lynn, founder of U.S. Tech Workers. Wolf “wrote the policy in the corporate interest, not in the interest of American workers, and that tells me everything I need to know about him,” Lynn said, shortly after Trump announced the news.

“Is Wolf the guy I would have picked if I were emperor? — probably not,” said Mark Krikorian, the director of the Center for Immigration Studies. “He’s the acting secretary and the first term ends in five months. It doesn’t seem productive to reshuffle the deck yet again, and if Trump wins reelection, then they can get a look at who might be better.”

I am pleased to inform the American Public that Acting Secretary Chad Wolf will be nominated to be the Secretary of Homeland Security. Chad has done an outstanding job and we greatly appreciate his service! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 25, 2020

Wolf has been working as the acting secretary of DHS since November 2019, when he was confirmed by the Senate as undersecretary for strategy, policy, and plans. The vote was 54-to-41, marking strong Democrat pressure against Trump’s nominees.

Wolf has strongly supported Trump’s efforts to block blue-collar migration across the southern border and has played a prominent role in denouncing the street rioters in Portland, Chicago, and other cities.

But he has done little to curb the Fortune 500’s outsourcing white-collar jobs to Indian and Chinese visa workers or to curb the universities’ huge Practical Training program. These programs keep at least 1.3 million foreign graduates in the jobs needed by U.S. graduates.

Similarly, Wolf has kept a very low profile on other critical issues, such as the enforcement of legal-worker laws against cheating employers, or the inflow of illegal workers via short-term travel visas, or the congressional fights over GOP Sen. Mike Lee’s S.386 and other draft laws.

Prior to Trump’s arrival, Wolf worked as a lobbyist for NASSCOM, the joint U.S.-Indian business group that supplies cheap labor for Fortune 500 companies.

“He hasn’t distinguished himself on the issue of worker protections, but I don’t get the sense that he is as bad as a lot of people fear,” Krikorian said. He continued:

This administration is not really all that hostile to guest-worker programs. They’re talking it up now [before the election, but] guest worker programs have never been something that President Trump has been opposed to. How much can you blame a cabinet member when the president has been ambivalent about guest-worker programs, at best?

Wolf worked as chief of staff to the prior DHS secretary, Kirstjen Nielsen, said Lynn. “He was not a person who was looking to resist immigration,” Lynn said, adding, “Ultimately, Trump deserves all the blame because he’s the one who selected this guy.”

Since 2016, Trump’s administration has seen a back-and-forth struggle between populist voters and business donors in the high-stakes economic fight over imported workers, consumers, and renters.

In 2018 and 2019, Trump overcame stiff opposition from the “swamp” to eventually block illegal blue-collar migration over the southern border.

“He insisted on a near-total focus on issues that he said were central to his reelection — in particular building a wall on the U.S. border with Mexico,” said an op-ed by former DHS official Miles Taylor. He worked as a top aide to pro-migration appointees and Republicans before creating an anti-Trump group.

That border security policy helped push up wages for blue-collar Americans at a faster rate than white-collar wages, but it still leaves millions of illegal migrants in the United States, where they nudge down wages and push up rents.

Since June 2020, Trump has begun to trim the huge inflow of white-collar visa workers who take jobs from U.S. college graduates. That is a late and incomplete response to his March 2016 promise: “I will end forever the use of the H-1B as a cheap labor program and institute an absolute requirement to hire American workers first for every visa and immigration program. No exceptions.”

In contrast, Biden’s 2020 campaign is promising a nationwide amnesty for illegal immigrants, rapid increases in legal immigration, and a dramatic jump in refugee settlement. Democrats also promise a temporary halt to border enforcement, the inflow of more visa workers, plus a green card giveaway to many temporary visa workers who already have taken jobs from American graduates.",Trump Nominates Chad Wolf to DHS Chief,fake

The former Australian Prime Minister, who was born in the United Kingdom, has now been reportedly asked by Prime Minister Boris Johnson to lead efforts in securing post-Brexit trade deals on the international stage, notably the United States, Japan, Australia, and New Zealand.

Mr Abbott, a staunch supporter of the United Kingdom’s pro-sovereignty Brexit movement, has also been extremely outspoken on other areas of UK policy such as the growing migrant crisis in the English Channel.

On Tuesday a source within Whitehall told The Sun: “We are delighted to have him on board.”

The move was hailed by Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage, who said: “Tony Abbott is a talented and deeply principled man with a great commitment to Brexit. This is a good appointment.”

The mission of the Board of Trade, which was established in 1622, is to “champion exports and inward and outward investment to deliver economic growth and prosperity”, and is typically staffed by British politicians and top businessmen.

Speaking on the prospect of the United Kingdom leaving the European Union without a deal, Mr Abbot said last year: “Let me reassure anyone in Britain, anxious about the prospect of no deal, that Australia does one hundred billion dollars’ worth of trade with the EU every single year, on this very basis.”

‘Get This Done’: Former Aussie PM Tony Abbott Backs UK on Brexit https://t.co/5Op8vo2Baq — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) September 3, 2019

In a statement given to Breitbart London a top British conservative think-tank, The Bow Group, also praised the move to bring on the former Aussie PM, describing him as a “leading voice on the right globally” going on to note his love for Great Britain, the homeland of his father.

Bow Group chairman Ben Harris-Quinney said that when Mr Abbott led their 65th-anniversary celebrations a few years ago “he laid out what many in our own country miss, that Britain is globally revered as a world leader in culture, business and politics.”

“Sometimes it requires a bit of an outsider to remind us how great a country Britain is, and how we should be fiercely proud of that,” the conservative group leader said.

“He is uniquely well placed to lead trade missions in Australia, the US and across the Anglosphere to remake our place in the world post-Brexit,” he added.

Harris-Quinney said that the Conservative Party in the UK is “often bereft of conviction and talent” but that supporters of Brexit and Conservatives in the country should be “delighted” with the appointment of Abbott in a key trade position, who they characterised as a man of “principle and talent”.

“The only job he’d be better at is dealing with our immigration crisis, as his stop-the-boats policy is why Australia has fared far better at dealing with illegal immigration than Britain,” the Bow Group concluded.

Abbott to Farage: Bojo Needs His ‘Mojo’, Must Start Sending Back Illegal Boat Migrants to France https://t.co/5M6nyiaJuw — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) June 2, 2020

In a June interview with Brexit leader Nigel Farage, Mr Abbott said that Prime Minister Boris Johnson needed to get his “mojo back” as illegal boat migration in the English Channel began to pick up with the warmer weather.

Abbott also correctly predicted in June that illegal migration would quickly turn from a “trickle” into a “flood” if the British government failed to implement a policy that would immediately return migrant boats back to France. He also pointed to the perception among migrants that if they reach British shores they are unlikely to face deportation.

“As long as ‘to arrive is to remain’, people smugglers will have a business model and those countries that lack the will to say ‘no’ are at risk of peaceful invasion. This is the prospect that faces Britain if swift action is not taken to stop people coming illegally by boat,” Abbott wrote.

Under Operation Sovereign Borders implemented Mr Abbott’s government in 2013, illegal boat migration was completely halted by a military-led policy which disincentivised people-smuggling gangs sending boat migrants from Indonesia and other countries, by immediately turning back boat migrants at sea.

The coronavirus pandemic “has exposed and aggravated social problems, above all that of inequality,” the pontiff told those following his live-streamed remarks delivered from Library of the Apostolic Palace in the Vatican.

“Some people can work from home, while this is impossible for many others,” he said. “Certain children, notwithstanding the difficulties involved, can continue to receive an academic education, while this has been abruptly interrupted for many, many others.”

“Some powerful nations can issue money to deal with the crisis, while this would mean mortgaging the future for others,” he added.

These economic differences are pathological, the pope suggested, signs of a “sick economy.”

“These symptoms of inequality reveal a social illness; it is a virus that comes from a sick economy,” Francis said. “And we must say it simply: the economy is sick. It has become ill. It is sick.”

This sickness “is the fruit of unequal economic growth – this is the illness: the fruit of unequal economic growth – that disregards fundamental human values,” he said.

“In today’s world, a few rich people possess more than all the rest of humanity. I will repeat this so that it makes us think: a few rich people, a small group, possess more than all the rest of humanity. This is pure statistics. This is an injustice that cries out to heaven!” he said.

The pope went on to suggest that such unequal economic growth is the fruit of greed and demands rectification.

“When the obsession to possess and dominate excludes millions of persons from having primary goods,” he said, “when economic and technological inequality are such that the social fabric is torn; and when dependence on unlimited material progress threatens our common home, then we cannot stand by and watch.”

It is unclear from the pope’s words how he believes equal economic growth among nations and individuals should be achieved, or whether it is merely a question of redistribution of all the world’s wealth equally among individuals.

Catholic social teaching has, however, consistently recognized the natural differences among persons and nations and insisted that economic homogeneity is an unworkable utopia.

In the first “social encyclical,” Pope Leo XIII’s 1891 text Rerum Novarum, the pontiff called for a healthy realism, bearing with “the condition of things inherent in human affairs” for “it is impossible to reduce civil society to one dead level,” as opposed to the Socialists’ utopian efforts toward perfect economic equality, since “all striving against nature is in vain.”

Leo called to mind that manifold differences naturally exist among persons: “people differ in capacity, skill, health, strength; and unequal fortune is a necessary result of unequal condition.”

At the same time, Leo insisted that these natural inequalities are not necessarily evil, either for individuals or for the larger community. In fact, he wrote, social and public life “can only be maintained by means of various kinds of capacity for business and the playing of many parts; and each man, as a rule, chooses the part which suits his own peculiar domestic condition.”

While the Catholic Church teaches that there are, indeed, “sinful inequalities that affect millions of men and women,” which stand “in open contradiction of the Gospel,” it also recognizes that not all inequalities are evil and the campaign to impose perfect economic equality would cause more harm than it would alleviate.

“With the rights and freedoms each of you now enjoys as citizens, there is no dream beyond your wildest reach, because Americans can do anything,” Trump said after the brief naturalization ceremony. Trump then emphasized the immigrants’ moral and legal obligations to other Americans, saying:

Today, you have also accepted the profound duties and responsibilities that come with American citizenship. By swearing the oath of allegiance, each of you has entered a sacred and unbreakable covenant with our nation. You have pledged your undying loyalty to the American people, the American Constitution, and the American way of life. The history and heritage of the United States are now yours to preserve and pass down to the next generation. Our culture, our traditions, and our values are now yours to uphold and live by. The rights so dear to every American, granted by us and granted by God, and enshrined in our glorious Bill of Rights, are now yours to support, protect, and defend as citizens. You’re now stewards of this magnificent nation, a family comprised of every race, color, religion, and creed, united by the bonds of love where one people sharing one home, saluting one great American flag. Congratulations again to all of you. May God bless you and may God bless our great country, America.

The event was likely intended to help win slivers of votes from pockets of naturalized immigrants in swing states, and also to counter claims by critics that he is anti-immigrant.

Trump’s apolitical speech was sharply different from the speeches given by President Barack Obama to new citizens.

In reality, four of the five immigrants are likely to vote for the Democrat Party, which celebrates them as it promotes chaotic cultural diversity and champions demands for collective rights of competing subgroups instead of the unifying, individualistic ideals described by Trump.

However, given the record of prior immigrant groups, the five immigrants’ future grandchildren are likely to give up resentments and home-country rules, and then split their votes evenly between the two parties.

The migrants came from wildly different cultures — two men from Ghana and Bolivia, and three women from Lebanon, India, and Sudan. Most have been living in the United States for several years, legally, because they were earlier awarded green cards.

The migrants also allowed Trump to emphasize the contributions of skilled migrants, such as medical skills. Trump has repeatedly said he wants to shift immigration rules to favor skilled migrants, instead of migrants who have family ties to prior immigrants.

In reality, most migrants arrive with very limited cultural or workplace skills, or else they get their initial green card from Fortune 500 companies in exchange for taking jobs from Americans.

Democrat candidate Joe Biden’s immigration policy promises to dramatically increase the inflow of unskilled migrants to employers, retailers, and real-estate companies.

He promises a nationwide amnesty for illegal immigrants, rapid increases in legal immigration, and a dramatic jump in refugee settlement. Democrats also promise a temporary halt to border enforcement, the inflow of more visa workers, plus a green card giveaway to many temporary visa workers who already have taken jobs from American graduates.

In contrast, Trump has promised to exclude migrants who depend on government welfare and to bar companies from using foreign workers to replace Americans.

The oath sworn by the new immigrants reflected the United States’ centuries-long history of immigration, including the long period of low immigration from the 1920s to the 1970s:

I hereby declare, on oath, that I absolutely and entirely renounce and abjure all allegiance and fidelity to any foreign prince, potentate, state, or sovereignty of whom or which I have heretofore been a subject or citizen; that I will support and defend the Constitution and laws of the United States of America against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; that I will bear arms on behalf of the United States when required by the law; that I will perform noncombatant service in the Armed Forces of the United States when required by the law; that I will perform work of national importance under civilian direction when required by the law; and that I take this obligation freely without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion; so help me God.",Munro: Donald Trump Holds Idealistic Naturalization Ceremony at RNC,fake

“Geno is a truck driver from Ohio, who heard politicians for years make empty promises about defending American jobs, only to see those promises broken again and again,” Vice President Mike Pence said in a video montage during the second evening of the Republican National Convention (RNC). He continued:

In 2019, when General Motors closed its plant in Lordstown, Ohio. President Donald Trump refused to stand by and watch it happen. And as Geno observed, this president reached out to General Motors to find a way to bring jobs back to Lordstown. And plans were soon set into motion to create Lordstown Motors.

“President Trump says. ‘This is how we fix it.’ And I thought, well that’s a simple solution,” DiFabio said. “There’s no other president … there’s no other that even tried to do it.”

As Breitbart News has chronicled, GM CEO Mary Barra idled the Lordstown plant last year — resulting in the immediate layoff of about 1,600 American workers, and since 2017, GM has laid off about 4,500 American workers in Ohio. Economists have said GM’s idling in Lordstown will eventually result in the layoff of about 8,000 American workers in supporting industries.

With pressure from Trump, GM sold the plant to Lordstown Motors, a cutting-edge electric vehicle company, which is now vowing to hire about 600 Americans next year to help produce its first round of 20,000 all-electric pickup trucks known as the Endurance.

In 2022, Lordstown Motors expects to hire more workers to produce a line of all-electric SUVs and pickup trucks.

After its initial hiring of about 600 Americans, executives hope to hire an additional 4,000 to 5,000 for the plant as early as 2022 to produce other all-electric vehicles based on demand.

Likewise, GM broke ground on construction for a new factory in Lordstown that will produce battery cells and packs.

American manufacturing is vital to the U.S. economy, as every manufacturing job supports an additional 7.4 American jobs in other industries. Decades of free trade have eliminated five million manufacturing jobs from the American economy and resulted in the closure of about 50,000 manufacturing plants.

VERDICT: True. In the last few years, specifically as a result of Trump’s 25 percent tariffs on foreign steel, brought an employment boom and economic stability to Minnesota’s Iron Range communities.

“[China] — and other supposed trade partners — dumped steel into our markets and slapped tariffs on us, tipping the scales in their favor. And what did our leaders do? Nothing,” Vlaisaljevich continued. “Then to make matters worse, the Obama-Biden administration crushed us with environmental regulations.”

“The human and economic cost has been devastating,” he said. “Even in our tiny town, we lost thousands of jobs . . . a 70% drop from 14,000 to 4,000. We lost a generation of young people who had to move out of the area to find a livelihood.”

“Four years later, I am happy to say that after decades of despair, the Iron Range is roaring back to life and we have one man to thank: President Donald Trump,” Vlaisaljevich said.

“He has made good on all of his campaign promises, and then some. He has fought to give us a fair chance to compete. He has become the ‘champion of working Americans,'” a blue-collar billionaire.

The Iron Range’s comeback, thanks to Trump’s agenda, has been well-documented over the last few years.

In March of last year, the Star Tribune reported:

Mines and logging companies are hiring, small businesses are expanding and Minnesota’s Iron Range is bouncing back from the mine and production facility closures that hit hard just a few years ago. [Emphasis added] … “A 5.2 percent increase in employment means a lot of money in the economy in northeastern Minnesota,” said Kelsey Johnson, president of the Iron Mining Association of Minnesota. “It means that families are able to pay for their necessities and have a little bit of savings at home as well.” [Emphasis added] … Iron ore exports were up 42 percent in the third quarter of 2018 compared to the previous year, the forecast states. [Emphasis added]

In October 2018, Breitbart News reported how American steel workers in the Iron Range were able to secure a wage boost thanks to the president’s agenda:

The 1,850 American steelworkers who are set to see wage increases are based in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan’s Tilden and Empire mines and the United Taconite and Hibbing Taconite mines in Iron Range, Minnesota. [Emphasis added]

Trump’s agenda has also helped bring supporting industries back to the Iron Range, as the Star Tribune reported in July 2018:

Bailey and his wife, Tracy, bought the shuttered Courtyard Cafe on historic Howard Street. In December, they received some splashy company when the large BoomTown Brewery & Woodfire Grill opened a block up the road. Not far away, cranes and cement trucks are cranking out factory additions at the pipemaker Iracore International, the truck cooling-system maker L&M Radiator and the custom manufacturer Range Steel Fabricators. … The level of activity has surprised some locals, but the reason behind it is clear: The iron ore companies are healthy again. Idled plants are reopened, with 2,000 employees back to work. [Emphasis added]

Oakland’s decision not to play Thursday night came a day after three Major League Baseball games were postponed in response to the police shooting of a Black man in Wisconsin last weekend.

“We respect the decision by the Oakland A’s players to postpone tonight’s game,” the Rangers said in a statement less than three hours before the scheduled first pitch. “We stand with all those who condemn racial injustice and are committed to helping bring about an end to systemic racism.”

After Wednesday night’s game, A’s manager Bob Melvin said his team had discussed whether to take the field then, but that those talks “were just kind of too rushed” when they were able to get together. He said they were united in the decision to play and then “talk about it more as a group, extensively as a group.”

The finale of the four-game series was set to be a nationally televised game on Fox’s main network.

Texas manager Chris Woodward said there were some individual conversations with his players before Wednesday’s game and they were OK playing. He said then that the Rangers were going to “fully support” any of their players who decided not to play, and the same for the A’s if they decided not to play.

The three games postponed Wednesday — the Cincinnati Reds and Brewers in Milwaukee, Seattle Mariners and Padres in San Diego and the Los Angeles Dodgers and Giants in San Francisco — were being made up as part of doubleheaders Thursday.

Those baseball postponements came after the NBA’s Milwaukee Bucks didn’t come out on the floor for Game 5 of their first-round playoff series with the Orlando Magic on Wednesday at Lake Buena Vista, Florida. NBA officials later announced that all three of the day’s scheduled playoff games had been postponed, and games scheduled Thursday also weren’t played.

“I don’t know much about the NBA protests,” Trump said. “I know their ratings have been very bad, because I think people are a little tired of the NBA frankly.”

Trump commented during a visit to FEMA’s headquarters in Washington, DC, on Thursday afternoon for an update on the response to Hurricane Laura.

The president was asked about the NBA player protests after players boycotted their playoff games Tuesday night in the name of racial justice.

“They’ve become like a political organization, and that’s not a good thing,” Trump said. “I don’t think that’s a good thing for sports or the country.”

“Brett Favre played the MNF game the day his dad died, threw 4 TDs in the first half and was a legend for playing in the face of adversity,” Urlacher wrote according to the Chicago Sun-Times. “NBA players boycott the playoffs because a dude reaching for a knife, wanted on [a] felony sexual assault warrant, was shot by police.”

Breitbart News reported that the NBA’s Milwaukee Bucks opted to boycott the fifth game of the Eastern Conference playoffs in light the August 23, 2020, officer-involved shooting of Jacob Blake. As a result of the Bucks’ decision, the NBA announced it would postpone three other playoff games set to take place as a show of support.

Democrat presidential candidate Joe Biden praised the Bucks for refusing to play, tweeting, “This moment demands moral leadership. And these players answered by standing up, speaking out, and using their platform for good. Now is not the time for silence.”

Harris followed in Biden’s footsteps, tweeting support for the two leagues after games were cancelled:

It takes monumental courage to stand up for what you believe in. NBA and WNBA players, keep standing up and demanding change. https://t.co/CRNbfoH1wL — Kamala Harris (@KamalaHarris) August 27, 2020

The WNBA’s Washington Mystics responded to the officer-involved shooting by donning shirts that spelled out Jacob Blake’s name on front, while the backs of the shirts were covered with images of seven bullet holes:

Blake was shot and injured August 23, 2020, in Kenosha, Wisconsin, Sunday at 5 p.m.

On August 26, 2020, Breitbart News reported a Wisconsin Department of Justice report which says police first used a taser against Blake, but “it was not successful.” As Blake leaned forward into his car Officer Rusten Sheskey held on to his shirt then fired the rounds that injured Blake.

The Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel reported that “Blake told police he had a knife in an interview following the shooting. It is unclear whether responding officers knew Blake had a knife. Attorney General Josh Kaul in a news conference was asked repeatedly about it and declined to be more specific.”

The team lined up before the empty sidelines spelling out Blake’s name with their shirts, then they took a knee on the court.

Blake is, of course, the Kenosha, Wisconsin, man who was shot on August 23 by police after a brief physical struggle and after refusing to obey repeated demands to submit to arrest. Blake is reportedly paralyzed from the wounds.

The league quickly canceled all its games for Wednesday and Friday in solidarity with the Mystics payers.

Speaking for her team, guard Ariel Atkins delivered a statement about the team’s feelings on the Blake shooting.

“We wanted everybody to feel like they were supported,” Atkins said of the team’s decision. “Understanding that this isn’t just about basketball. We aren’t just basketball players and just because we are basketball players, doesn’t mean that’s our only platform. We need to understand that when most of us go home, we still are Black, in the sense that our families matter.”

“We got this little guy right here,” she said of the child the team brought out onto the court with them for their stunt. “His life matters. He needs to know that he can do what he wants to do whenever he leaves his house. When he grows up. Within reason, you don’t need to go out there crazy, but he matters. And that’s what people need to understand. We’re not just basketball players, and if you think we are, then don’t watch us. You’re watching the wrong sport, because we’re so much more than that. We’re gonna say what we need to say. And people need to hear that. And if they don’t support that, I’m fine with that.”

“We need to understand that these moments are so much more bigger than us, and I really appreciate my team, for not only having my back, but for saying what they feel,” Atkins continued. “It’s hard to say that type of stuff in these moments. It’s hard to be vulnerable in these moments. But I think if we do this unified as a league, it looks different. Because this league is close to, if not over, 80 percent Black women.

“We have cousins, we have brothers, we have sisters, mothers, everyone—we matter,” she concluded. “And I think that’s important. I think people should know that. And I’m tired of telling people that. I know I matter. We know we matter. I’m tired of telling people that. If you don’t know that, if you don’t think that, then you need to recheck it. If you have a problem with us saying ‘Black lives matter,’ you need to check your privilege.”

Kellerman disputed the suggestion that cancelation of a college football in SEC football states, which are primarily Republican, would dissuade these fans on their support for President Donald Trump.

He argued Trump would shift the blame and that the fans of these colleges would not be convinced the President was, in part, to blame.

“[S]tephen A., you made the argument a couple of weeks ago that you thought that if SEC football was not played that could swing the general election because people in the base, in Trump’s base, would be very upset that they did not have football, which is practically a religion down there,” he said. “And I disagreed because he would simply shift blame and, you know, because of the pandemic that is raging.”

“And if they seem to be very low quality — susceptible to low-quality information and very easy to propagandize and almost immune to facts because as Kellyanne Conway, adviser to Trump, said, they have alternate facts,” Kellerman continued. “And if they stayed in their propaganda silo, like the Fox News propaganda silo, they would say, ‘Oh no, the handling of the pandemic has been great.’ The handling of the pandemic has been by far the worst in the industrialized democratic world by far, the United States, by far at the federal level. It has been a disaster. And as a result, we’re dealing with this pandemic. And yet I did not think that that would affect voters because the blame would be shifted.

Kellerman argued the impact could be different if the National Football League interrupted its season because of “social justice issues.”

“If the NFL does not play football look, I think that the NFL players have a lot of power here,” Kellerman said. “If they do not play football, at a certain point, there will be — the base, the core will remain, but the football base goes all throughout the country and does not just hit one or another’s political base, but in so far as there are such things as swing voters still, it will absolutely affect some of them.”

“If the NFL season is not played or is interrupted because of social justice issues, and we understand that this is all against the backdrop of the pandemic, I think — I know we exist in a sports bubble, and we have an outsized idea of the effect of sports,” he added. “But I think that that actually might have political consequences in a general election.”

In order to both practice and protest, the New Orleans Saints opted to put Jacob Blake’s name on their helmets.

“Coach Sean Payton told reporters that the team decided last night to honor Blake with the gesture,” Pro Football Talk reported.

Saints cornerback Janoris Jenkins put a pic of his helmet with Blake’s name on it on Instagram. In the message, Jenkins wrote: “If you stand for nothing then you’ll fall for anything.”

“Kenosha has been marred by violent unrest since police shot Jacob Blake several times in the back while responding to a domestic incident on Sunday,” the UPI writes. “An eyewitness said that police told Blake to “drop the knife,” though he himself did not witness Blake carrying a knife.”

Police confirmed that a knife was found on the scene on Wednesday.

NBA players opted to cancel their three scheduled playoff games on Wednesday in protest over the shooting, and had debated boycotting the remainder of their season. However, on Thursday, the players decided to complete the season while pursuing other social justice initiatives.

Also on Thursday, NFL Executive Vice President of Football Operations Troy Vincent got emotional during a radio interview on ESPN. Speaking of the Blake shooting, Vincent said through tears: ‘This sh*t…its gotta end.”

“If they want to protest, I don’t think we care,” Marc Short told CNN’s “New Day.”

His comments came the day after the NBA postponed three scheduled playoff games, with the Milwaukee Bucks kicking off the boycott by refusing to leave their locker room for the game against the Orlando Magic. The players are demanding that lawmakers act to address police brutality and racial injustice.

Players and teams from MLB, the WNBA, MLS and pro tennis sat out events Wednesday night, and NBA players and coaches met for nearly three hours to determine the next steps, including whether the season should continue.

“I don’t know that you are going to see the administration weigh in one way or the other. In my mind it’s absurd and silly,” Short said.

President Donald Trump, who was to deliver his renomination acceptance speech Thursday evening at a scaled-back Republican National Convention, has made restoring “law and order” to cities a centerpiece of his campaign during a summer of sometimes violent protests following the death of George Floyd, a Black man whose killing by Minneapolis police in late May spurred national unrest.

Short also took aim at the NBA’s relative silence over human rights abuses in China, a key market for the league. The NBA last month faced scathing criticism from Republicans after an ESPN report that young participants in a league program in China were physically beaten by Chinese instructors and were not provided proper schooling.

Short also questioned why the league’s players and coaches have largely refrained from criticizing China’s human rights violations and from expressing support for Hong Kong.

The league and its players have been outspoken in calls for reforms in the aftermath of the killing of Floyd. The NBA has even incorporated its support for the Black Lives Matter movement into player uniforms and advertising. Trump has called that movement “a symbol of hate.”

“NBA players are very fortunate that they have the financial position where they’re able to take a night off from work without having to have the consequences to themselves financially,’ White House senior adviser Jared Kushner said told CNBC on Thursday.

In a separate appearance before an event hosted by Politico, Kushner said that he planned to reach out to Los Angles Lakers star LeBron James, an outspoken advocate for policing changes.

“Look, I do think that peaceful protest has a place and it has importance,” Kushner said. “But I do think that what we need to do right now is make sure that we take the anger that people have and we have to move from slogans to constructive solutions.”

Sen. Tom Cotton, a Trump ally, told Fox News that the reaction by NBA players to the incident in Kenosha was “premature.”

(AP) — A person with knowledge of the situation says NBA players decided Thursday that they want to continue the season, coming to that consensus one day after three postseason games were postponed in a protest of racial injustice.

It was not clear yet when the season would resume, according to the person who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because neither the league nor the National Basketball Players Association had announced anything publicly.

The NBA’s board of governors were meeting separately Thursday to decide next steps. There were three games on Thursday’s schedule, and the league did not immediately say if they would be pushed back. But with the players exiting their meeting around noon, and the first game of the tripleheader scheduled to begin at 4 p.m. Eastern, it seemed most unlikely that the day’s slate would not be disrupted.

One potential remedy for the schedule, the person said, was to play the three games that were postponed Wednesday on Friday, and the three games scheduled for Thursday on Saturday, though that had not been decided.

Starting with the Milwaukee Bucks, who refused to take the court for their game Wednesday against the Orlando Magic, players from six teams made the extraordinary decisions to protest the shooting by police in Kenosha, Wisconsin on Sunday of Jacob Blake, a Black man, apparently in the back while three of his children looked on.

Kenosha is about 40 miles south of Milwaukee.

NBA players didn’t come to Disney solely for a restart to their season. They also wanted social reform, as did other sports leagues — many of which followed the NBA’s lead Wednesday by calling off games. Some NFL teams did the same Thursday, choosing not to practice.

It followed a similar pattern as what happened in March: The NBA was the first league to shut down because of the coronavirus pandemic, and other sports followed then as well.

“The biggest thing that we all understand is if we’re not playing, what are we doing? What are we doing to show and to help what’s going on outside this bubble?” Boston Celtics forward Grant Williams said, shortly before the Bucks were scheduled to tip off their game against the Magic.

Instead, the Bucks players remained in the locker room, finally emerging hours later to read a statement demanding action from lawmakers and encouraging voting by citizens.

They changed the narrative across the entire sports landscape, putting the focus squarely on social justice reform in protest of the shooting of Blake.

While players and teams from baseball, the WNBA and MLS sat out their competitions Wednesday night, NBA players and coaches met for nearly three hours in a Disney hotel to determine next steps, including whether the season should continue. They did not come to a consensus, a person with knowledge of the meeting told AP on condition of anonymity because details weren’t revealed publicly.

More talks took place in the early hours of Thursday, followed by the player meeting that morning to decide to continue the season.

The Western & Southern Open won’t be played Thursday, with the U.S. Tennis Association, along with the ATP and WTA Tours, announcing play would be paused after two-time Grand Slam women’s champion Naomi Osaka had already said she wouldn’t play her semifinal match.

“I don’t expect anything drastic to happen with me not playing, but if I can get a conversation started in a majority white sport I consider that a step in the right direction,” Osaka tweeted. “Watching the continued genocide of Black people at the hand of the police is honestly making me sick to my stomach.”

Before coming to Disney, many NBA players wrestled for weeks about whether it was even right to play, fearing that a return to games would take attention off the deaths of, among others, Breonna Taylor and George Floyd in recent months.

They ultimately decided coming to the bubble and playing televised games would give them the largest platform, though now at least some are wondering if that’s still true.

It appears now they will find out if that’s the case.","NBA Players Decide to Continue Season, Pursue Other Social Justice Initiatives",fake

One of the first to cancel its practice was the Washington Football Team, according to TMZ Sports.

Team head coach Ron Rivera insisted that he and team president Jason Wright made the decision to cancel the practice together.

“Jason Wright and I worked this afternoon to develop a response that has the right balance between the business of football and being truly thoughtful about the social injustice we witnessed with this latest incident in Wisconsin,” Rivera reportedly said on Thursday.

“We went to Mr. Snyder with our plan for tomorrow and we were given his complete support and approval,” he added.

“In place of our practice at FedEx Field,” Rivera exclaimed, “the players, coaches and football staff will meet as a football family and we will continue our open dialogue on the issues of racism and social injustice in our country.”

On the heels of the Washington Team’s decision, the New York Jets, Indianapolis Colts, Tennessee Titans, and Arizona Cardinals joined the Washington team in canceling their practices.

The Packers, Jaguars, and Bears postponed the start of their practices, but did not cancel them entirely.

Troy Vincent, the NFL’s executive vice president of football operations, broke down into tears during an interview on ESPN radio Thursday morning when speaking of how “proud” he was of NBA players for boycotting their playoff games due to the officer-involved shooting of Jacob Blake.

“This shit is — it’s gotta end,” Vincent said. “I’m so proud of these young boys. These young men and women. They did things I didn’t think about doing. I always walked for the community but during my time we thought we had a handle on it and obviously we didn’t.

“When I saw Doc Rivers and Lebron and George Hill, I think about my three boys and I’m sitting up here every day having about contact tracing and how we’re gonna play ball, and I got a 22-year-old and 20-year-old and a 15-year-old that I’m trying to prevent from being hunted. And they’re teachable moments and I’m trusting my Lord, trusting Him. I’m just proud of what the guys and the women are doing. As we would say, a unified people would always defeat unified money. And I’m just proud. I’m proud.”

The notion of young black men being “hunted,” has become a common one in social justice advocacy. On Tuesday, LeBron James said that the 2nd Amendment made black people feel “hunted.”

Three NFL teams canceled practices on Thursday in protest of Blake’s shooting. The NBA is likely to make a decision on the future of their season, Thursday afternoon.

“They have the luxury taking a night off from work. Most Americans don’t have the financial luxury to do that. I think that it’s nice that they’re standing up for the issue, but I’d like to see them start moving into concrete solutions that are productive,” he said.

He pointed to the Trump administration’s “proven track record” of pushing through criminal justice reform as an example where the president worked with both parties to develop and sign important legislation on the issue.

“With the NBA, there’s a lot of activism, and I think that they put a lot of slogans out, but I think that we need to turn that from slogans and signals to actual action that’s gonna solve the problem,” he added.

Kushner also criticized Democrats for failing to offer specific policy proposals.

“We need to bring it to constructive solutions,” he said. “I just think that look, we’re offering solutions with policy, the other side’s doing a lot of complaining.”",Jared Kushner Vows to Call LeBron James for 'Concrete Solutions',fake

Doesn’t need them to cut a check to his charity, either.

“If you give your time, that’s the only way we can change,” he said.

Smith spoke through tears Wednesday night after deciding for the first time to protest during “The Star-Spangled Banner” before New York played the Miami Marlins. It was a last-minute decision, spurred by reports he’d seen moments earlier about athletes boycotting games across the country.

“I think the most difficult part is to see people still don’t care. For this to just continuously happen, it just shows the hate in people’s heart. That just sucks, you know?""

While the Mets were at Citi Field, three Major League Baseball games were postponed, along with games in the NBA, Major League Soccer and the WNBA. The athlete-driven protests are a reaction to the shooting by police in Kenosha, Wisconsin, on Sunday of Jacob Blake, a Black man, apparently in the back while three of his children looked on.

By the time Smith recognized the gravity of actions being taken by other professional athletes, the Mets and Marlins were deep into their warmups, first pitch moments away.

“To kind of see those things happen very fast, it wasn’t really a thought over here,” Smith said. “But that’s why I decided to take a knee tonight.

“I’ve been very emotional. Just to kind of see this continuously happen, I mean, it was a long day for me. Kind of wasn’t there mentally.

“I think the most difficult part is to see people still don’t care. For this to just continuously happen, it just shows the hate in people’s heart. That just sucks, you know? Black men in America, it’s not easy. Like I said, I just wasn’t there today, but I’ll bounce back, I’ll be fine.”

Smith is a 25-year-old Black man from Los Angeles who was a first-round draft pick by the Mets after participating in MLB’s Reviving Baseball in Inner Cities (RBI) youth program. Following the killings of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor, and the shooting of Blake and others, Smith has been vocal about the injustices he’s faced, both as a citizen and in a predominantly white sport.

“His world is much different than mine,” teammate Michael Conforto said Wednesday. “So it’s definitely helped me to listen and understand where he’s coming from and where a ton of people are coming from here.”

Smith didn’t tell teammates he planned to kneel Wednesday, and Conforto wasn’t even on the field when the anthem was played. Conforto said he wished he had been there to support Smith, but also said he wouldn’t kneel.

“It’s the same as his decision to kneel,” Conforto said. “Everybody has their decision. It’s what I’ve always done. I think it’s as simple as that. I don’t look at Dom any differently because he kneels. I think it’s as simple as that.”

Smith said he doesn’t care if white teammates kneel with them — “it’s not for them,” he said. He’s happy teammates are listening, but also delivered an emotional plea while speaking with reporters about the needs of Black children — particularly the ones in inner cities, growing up just like Smith did.

“Money is just material things,” said Smith, who works with the BaseballGenerations foundation to provide an outlet for inner-city kids.

“I didn’t grow up with money,” adding that “doesn’t mean nothing to me.”

“If you can give your time, that’s the thing that matters. That’s why I feel so emotional about it, because people give their money, they leave. Can’t do that. You have to be there for the children that are coming up after,” he said.",WATCH: Mets’ Smith Pleads Through Tears: ‘People Still Don’t Care’,fake

Soon after, the whole tournament was put on hold for a day.

“As a sport, tennis is collectively taking a stance against racial inequality and social injustice that once again has been thrust to the forefront in the United States. The USTA, ATP Tour, and WTA have decided to recognize this moment in time by pausing tournament play at the Western & Southern Open on Thursday, Aug. 27,” the three oganizations said in a statement.

Osaka, the Japanese star and last Top 10 seed in the women’s bracket, joined professional athletes in basketball, baseball and soccer in demanding change after Jacob Blake was shot by police.

Osaka tweeted that as a Black woman, she feels compelled to pull out of the tournament to put a focus on police shooting Black people.

“I don’t expect anything drastic to happen with me not playing, but if I can get a conversation started in a majority white sport I consider that a step in the right direction,” Osaka tweeted. “Watching the continued genocide of Black people at the hand of the police is honestly making me sick to my stomach.

“I’m exhausted of having a new hashtag pop up every few days and I’m extremely tired of having this same conversation over and over again. When will it ever be enough?”

Her move quickly got support from others players on the tour.

Sloane Stephens retweeted the message and added: “Say it louder! Proud of you” and in a separate tweet added, #Proud of all the sports teams and athletes taking a stand tonight #BLM”

After reaching the semifinals late Wednesday, Milos Raonic said the ATP and WTA should consider a joint action that goes beyond a small group of players.

“I think real disruption, that’s what makes change, and I think a lot of real disruption is caused by affecting people in a monetary way and can force some kind of change,” he said. “I’m hoping at least we on the men’s tour as well as the women’s, we band together and we show support.”

All NBA and WNBA games, three Major League Baseball games and five of six Major League Soccer games were called off Wednesday as athletes demanded racial justice.

Osaka beat No. 12 Anett Kontaveit 4-6, 6-2, 7-5 on Wednesday afternoon, reaching the semifinals as the only Top 10 player left in the bracket. Late Wednesday, she was still scheduled to play No. 14 Elise Mertens in the semifinals.

Victoria Azarenka will play eighth-seeded Johanna Konta in the other women’s semifinal. Konta beat Maria Sakkari 6-4, 6-3, and Azarenka advanced in straight sets against Ons Jabeur.

Azarenka, who was No. 1 in 2012, acknowledged Wednesday that she had considered retiring at the start of the year. She’s currently No. 59 but has reached her first semifinal since April 2019.

“In January, I didn’t know if I was going to play at all,” she said. “So end of January, I decided: You know what? I might try, last time, and see what happens.”

In the men’s bracket, top-ranked Novak Djokovic had no problems with his creaky neck or the swirling winds during a 6-3, 6-1 victory over Jan-Lennard Struff that was by far his best showing of the week.

So far, no rust at all after the long layoff from competitive tennis.

“Everything was worked on in the last six months, I had plenty of time,” Djokovic said. “I worked on every single thing. It’s great it’s paying off so early after the break.”

Djokovic tested positive for COVID-19 after exhibition matches he organized in Serbia and Croatia in June with no social distancing.

In his match Monday against Ricardas Berankis, Djokovic had his sore neck massaged twice by a trainer during a 7-6 (2), 6-4 victory that included seven double faults. The neck has gotten better, and so has his overall game.

“Right now it’s not a concern,” he said. “It’s still not 100% but it’s close to that. I’ve been gaining more range in my movement of the neck every single day, so no complaints.”

In the semifinals, he’ll face Roberto Bautista Agut, who knocked out defending champion Daniil Medvedev earlier in the day.

Medvedev failed to close it out in the second set, and Bautista Agut rallied for a 1-6, 6-4, 6-3 victory that eliminated yet another top player out of the tune-up tournament for the U.S. Open. Djokovic is the only player left in the tournament with an ATP Masters 1000 title to his credit.

Medvedev led 4-3 in the second before letting it slip away. He converted only five of 20 break points in the match and swatted his racket against the court in frustration at the end.

“Even in the third set I had my chances and didn’t take them,” Medvedev said.

Bautista Agut reached his third Masters semfinal and his first since 2016. He needed a set to adjust to the breezy, cooler conditions on court.

“It’s never easy to come back and play good at first,” he said. “I have to be patient, to try to enjoy every single match I play here after six months without competing. Just pleased and happy to be in the semifinals.”

Medvedev hoisted the champion’s Rookwood Pottery cup last year in Mason, Ohio, where the tournament is held annually. This year’s event was moved to the U.S. Open site in Flushing Meadows because of pandemic precautions, creating a two-tournament event without spectators.

Fourth-seeded Stefanos Tsitsipas also advanced to the semifinals when Reilly Opelka withdrew during the first set of their match Wednesday after getting treatment for an injured right knee. He’ll face Raonic, who beat Filip Krajinovic 4-6, 7-6 (2), 7-5.",Osaka Withdraws in Protest; W&S Put on Hold Thursday,fake

Biden, the presumptive Democrat nominee, took to social media shortly after the Milwaukee Bucks opted to boycott the fifth game of the Eastern Conference playoffs. The Bucks, who were set to face off against the Orlando Magic, decided to not take the court in solidarity with Jacob Blake, the 29-year-old African American man from Kenosha, Wisconsin, who was shot in the back seven times by police. As a result of the Bucks’ decision, the NBA announced it would postpone three other playoff games set to take place as a show of support.

In his statement, which was posted on Twitter, the former vice president applauded the team for taking a moral stand.

“This moment demands moral leadership. And these players answered by standing up, speaking out, and using their platform for good,” Biden said. “Now is not the time for silence.”

The former vice president’s comments came only hours after he condemned the “needless violence” that has arisen across Wisconsin in response to Blake’s shooting on Sunday. As local outlets have widely reported, protests broke out on the streets of Kenosha shortly after the video of Blake’s encounter with police went viral.

“When I was 22 years old, I thought all my dreams had come true when I was drafted by the New York Jets. Ten years later, with a Pro Bowl nod and a Super Bowl championship under my belt, I left the NFL to start a business,” he said.

“I thought I could never fail, but I did. And I lost everything. As I moved my family of six into a one-bedroom basement apartment in Brooklyn, New York, I faced a crossroads: feel sorry for myself or get to work,” Owens said.

“I worked as a chimney sweep during the day and a security guard at night. It was humbling to be recognized cleaning a chimney by someone who once cheered for me in an NFL stadium,” he said.

Owens said he worked hard and took a job in the corporate world.

“Second chances are at the core of our American identity,” the Utah congressional candidate said.

He argued Democrats, namely House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, don’t see it the same way.

“Career politicians and even a former bartender, want us to believe that’s impossible,” he said.

“I’m running for Congress because we don’t need more career politicians. We need a few more chimney sweeps,” Owens added.

Owens began his speech by telling his family history in America.

“Shackled in the belly of a slave ship, an eight-year-old named Silas Burgess came to America to be sold on an auction block,” he said.

“By the grace of God, and the courage of slaves who believed in freedom, Silas escaped through the Underground Railroad and settled in the great state of Texas,” Owens told the convention.

“He went on to become a successful entrepreneur. He built his community’s first church, first elementary school, and purchased 102 acres of farmland,” he said.

“I’m here today, a candidate for Congress, because of my great great grandfather, Silas Burgess,” Owens said.

Kennedy’s call to put service to America over self-service, said Lou Holtz, former NFL and college football coach, during his featured speech at the the Republican National Convention on Wednesday.

During Kennedy’s inaugural address to the nation, he remarked, “Ask not what your country can do for you. Ask what you can do for your country.”

Holtz said, “There are people today like politicians, professors, protesters, and of course, President Trump’s naysayers in the media, who like to blame others for problems. They don’t have pride in our country, because they no longer ask, ‘What can I do for my country?’ Only what the country should be doing for them. They don’t have pride in themselves. That’s wrong.”



Holtz added, “When I was an officer in the army, I served with so many great Americans who embraced their responsibility to our country. I’m so proud of their sacrifices and the opportunity it has provided for so many millions. America remains a land of opportunity, no matter what the other side says or believes.”

Holtz said he lives his life based on three values: trust, commitment, and love.

Former Vice President Joe Biden (D) and Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) are running “the most radically pro-abortion campaign” in American history, remarked Holtz.

“Nobody is a stronger advocate for the unborn than President Trump,” Holtz declared. “The Biden-Harris ticket is the most radically pro-abortion campaign in history. They and other politicians are Catholics-in-name-only and abandoned innocent lives. President Trump protects those lives.”

Holtz shared the questions he asks himself in determining his associations and evaluating people’s character: “Can I trust them?” “Are they committed to doing their very best?” “Do they love people; do they care about others?”.

“President Trump loves our country and our great people,” concluded Holtz. “Trust, commitment, and love. With President Trump, we have a president we can trust, who works hard in making America greater, and genuinely cares about people. If I apply this test to Joe Biden, I can’t say yes to any of these three questions.”

As the Association called-off three playoff games as a form of protest over the officer-involved shooting of Jacob Blake in Wisconsin.

The 44th president captioned a video of Los Angeles Clippers coach Doc Rivers and expressed that “all our institutions” needed to “stand up for our values.”

Obama’s tweet comes in the wake of the decision of the Milwaukee Bucks, and several other players and teams, deciding to not play their three playoff games on Wednesday. Believing instead, that their efforts could be better utilized fighting for social justice.

As the Associated Press reports:

The dramatic series of moves began when the Bucks — the NBA’s team from Wisconsin, a state rocked in recent days by the shooting by police officers of Jacob Blake, a Black man — didn’t take the floor for their playoff game against the Magic. The teams were set to begin Game 5 of their series shortly after 4 p.m., with the Bucks needing a win to advance to the second round. Players had been discussing boycotting games in the bubble after the shooting of Blake by police in Kenosha, Wisconsin. More discussions were scheduled Wednesday, but even before that the Bucks apparently decided they would act. ‘Some things are bigger than basketball,’ Bucks senior vice president Alex Lasry tweeted. ‘The stand taken today by the players and (the organization) shows that we’re fed up. Enough is enough. Change needs to happen. I’m incredibly proud of our guys and we stand 100% behind our players ready to assist and bring about real change.’ There are three other playoff games scheduled Thursday. It was unclear if they would be affected. Several NBA players, including LeBron James, tweeted out messages demanding change and the Boston Celtics’ official Twitter account did the same.

According to ESPN NBA reporter Adrian Wojnarowski, all NBA players are having a discussion to decide whether to continue the season.

Now that she is Joe Biden’s vice presidential running mate, the meaning of “for the people” has become clear: elite Hollywood left-wingers, like J.J. Abrams and Ryan Murphy.

Deadline reported that uber TV producer Ryan Murphy and his husband, David Miller, are chairing a September 3 fundraiser where Hollywood bigwigs will throw hundreds of thousands of dollars at the vice presidential candidate in the hopes of propelling her — and Joe Biden — to victory.

Ticket prices reportedly start at $10,000 per person, rising to $250,000 for “host” level. The guest list features some of corporate Hollywood’s most powerful executives — Amazon Studios’ Jennifer Salke, ICM Partner’s Chris Silbermann, and horror movie producer Jason Blum.

J.J. Abrams will serve as a host for the event, along with Universal Pictures’s Donna Langley, TV producer Chuck Lorre, and Disney TV head Dana Walden. Filmmaker Lee Daniels and Getty family scion William Getty are also serving as co-hosts for the fundraiser.

“We couldn’t be more excited for our friend Senator Kamala Harris to join the Democratic ticket and be our Vice Presidential Nominee.” the invitation reads, according to Deadline. “In less than twelve weeks, we have the chance to make history and elect Joe Biden as the next President and Senator Harris as the first woman to serve as Vice President.”

Kamala Harris has long been a darling of the Hollywood elite since her days serving as California Attorney General. Harris regularly dipped into the Hollywood fundraising pool in her run for the U.S. Senate, cultivating deep ties to studio executives and celebrities.

During her failed presidential run, Harris garnered financial support from some of Hollywood’s biggest power brokers, including Jeffrey Katzenberg and Steven Spielberg.

Now Harris is hoping to transfer some of that Hollywood magic to her 77-year-old running mate. Since his surprise success on Super Tuesday, Joe Biden has made numerous virtual stops in Hollywood where celebrities who were once lukewarm to the Delaware senator have coalesced around his White House bid.

The Biden campaign recently hosted an online fundraiser starring Barack Obama and George Clooney. Other recent fundraisers included appearances by John Legend, Barbra Streisand and Jay Leno.

Farrow also appeared to question Henderson’s record as a fighter for civil rights by putting the words “civil rights pioneer” in quotes.

In his RNC speech, Clarence Henderson praised President Trump for his work in helping black Americans, saying that the president has done more for blacks in four years than Joe Biden has done in nearly 50 years in Congress. “Joe Biden had the audacity to say if you don’t vote for him ‘you ain’t black.’ Well to that, I say, if you do vote for Biden, you don’t know history.”

His speech led to a short-circuit in Mia Farrow’s mind. “How can Clarence Henderson, billed as a ‘civil rights pioneer’ say these things. WHY?” she tweeted.

Everyone who donates to the initiative will be entered into sweepstakes where the winner and a friend will be flown to Seattle and shown around by both Vedder and Ament.

The grand prize details are described as follows:

Ready to live every Pearl Jam fan’s dream? You and a guest are off to the place where it all began, Seattle, for a special hometown experience with the band. You’ll meet Eddie Vedder and Jeff Ament at the Pearl Jam: Home and Away exhibit at MoPOP to hear stories from the guys as you stroll through three decades of Pearl Jam history—including artwork, stage props, instruments and more. (Over 21? There may be beers.) You’ll also score an exclusive tour of London Bridge Studios where Pearl Jam recorded their debut album, Ten. And even stay at the decked out Pearl Jam Suite at The Edgewater Hotel. Your flights are on us, too!

Money raised from the campaign will go toward Pearl Jam’s non-profit organization, The Vitalogy Foundation and various other non-profits running get out the vote campaigns. “Voting freely and easily is our ultimate right as citizens of these United States,” Ament said in a statement. “Please join us in pledging to VOTE BY MAIL, as early as possible, in this critical election.”

“Every donation supports our nonprofit organization called the Vitalogy Foundation and the organizations. We’re working with currently to protect voting rights across the country and making sure that every American can vote safely by mail from home,” Vedder said. “We’re asking all our supporters to join us in Pearl Jam and pledge to vote by mail in this critical election.

Watch below:

Although the effort is not explicitly partisan, Pearl Jam has made no secret about it’s opposition to President Donald Trump. In March, the Rock Hall of Famers publicly called out the Trump administration’s response to the Chinese coronavirus.

In 2018, Pearl Jame caused controversy after a poster for their get-out-the-vote concert promoting Sen. Jon Tester (D-MT) ahead of the midterm elections featured a dead President Donald Trump and an American bald eagle eating the remains of his corpse. The poster was disavowed by Tester, who eventually won re-election, although he refused to condemn it.

Pearl Jam is not the only group of celebrities currently working on get out the vote efforts. Earlier this week, The West Wing cast, along with show creator Aaron Sorkin, confirmed they would be reuniting for an HBO Max special to raise money for When We All Vote, the organization founded by Michelle Obama that is aggressively seeking to register young voters and pushing voting by mail.

Sources inform me Noah had originally intended to send the taunt via telegraph or a cave drawing, until one of his cutting edge staffers informed him of this advertising breakthrough in newspapers. Apparently, Noah was so excited and surprised by the speed of technology, the monocle fell from his eye, the buggy whip dropped from his hand, and the rest is comedy history.

Pelosi began by discussing the rioting that has taken place in Kenosha, Wisconsin, following Blake being shot seven times in the back after resisting arrest. “Jacob Blake was shot seven times for something — well, when you saw it, it didn’t seem as if there was any justification for it,” said Pelosi, “Especially in front of his children.”

Watch below:

Pelosi also weighed in on the case of Kyle Rittenhouse, a 17-year-old who was charged with shooting and killing two people during Tuesday’s unrest.

According to Pelosi, Trump should think about taking some responsibility for the shootings because of his recent rhetoric about law and order. On Wednesday, the president confirmed he would send the National Guard into Kenosha at the request of Democratic Governor Tony Evers.

“What is the responsibility that the president needs to feel about what encouragement, or whatever the word is, that he may have given?” asked Pelosi. “The comfort level for someone to do such a thing and be so brazen about it?”

…TODAY, I will be sending federal law enforcement and the National Guard to Kenosha, WI to restore LAW and ORDER! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 26, 2020

The 80-year-old California Democrat also pushed back against claims that Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden is a Trojan horse for herself and the radical left, insisting that he will win this year’s election.

“To their peril, they underestimate Joe Biden He’s going to be a great President of the United States,” Pelosi said. “He has a vision for our country which is very positive. Respectful of the dignity and worth of every person. He has knowledge of the issues, which is something they are also lacking — knowledge and judgment. He always thinks in a strategic way how to get things done.”

“His authenticity, his connection, his empathy for the American people is something that they probably wouldn’t even recognize, could never identify with, and are very different from Joe Biden on,” she continued, referring to Republicans and the Trump campaign.

“Sometimes we assume the most important work is the dramatic work—the street demonstrations. I like the term that [Marxist cultural critic] John Berger used: Demonstrations are ‘rehearsals for revolution,'” Davis told filmmaker Ava DuVernay in a wide-ranging interview in Vanity Fair.

Last time I interviewed this icon was for @13THFilm. I love learning from her. I encounter unexpected treasure whenever we speak. She effortlessly drops more knowledge than most have ever picked up. Her laugh is soft and musical and lovely. Thanks to my editor, Ta-Nehisi Coates. https://t.co/NnMytogv1Z — Ava DuVernay (@ava) August 26, 2020

Angela Davis, who was a longtime member of the Communist Party USA, also expressed sympathy for rioters who are tearing down historic statues: “Those statues are our reminders that the history of the United States of America is a history of racism. So it’s natural that people would try to bring down those symbols.”

In their Vanity Fair conversation, Davis told DuVernay that the Black Lives Matter riots and “defund the police” movement represent the culmination of decades of radical left-wing activism.

“The protests offered people an opportunity to join in this collective demand to bring about deep change, radical change,” Davis said. “Defund the police, abolish policing as we know it now. These are the same arguments that we’ve been making for such a long time about the prison system and the whole criminal justice system. It was as if all of these decades of work by so many people, who received no credit at all, came to fruition.”

Angela Davis also equated capitalism with racism. “Capitalism has always been racial capitalism,” she told DuVernay. “Wherever we see capitalism, we see the influence and the exploitation of racism.”

She also pushed for free healthcare and childcare as a way of redressing racism. “Not only should there be free education, but there should be free childcare and there should be free health care as well. All of these issues are coming to a head. This is, as you said, a racial reckoning. A reexamination of the role that racism has played in the creation of the United States of America.”

Ava DuVernay acknowledged in a tweet that the editor of her interview with Davis was Ta-Nehisi Coates, the author and journalist whose 2014 Atlantic article “The Case for Reparations” reignited the push for slavery reparations.

Following the BBC’s decision to remove the lyrics of the song in its Last Night of the Proms broadcast, the executive producer of the BBC’s Songs of Praise and CEO of the production company Nine Lives Media, Cat Lewis, claimed that the song’s line ‘Britons never, never, never shall be slaves’ is similar to if neo-Nazis shouted: “We will never be forced into a gas chamber”.

“Do those Brits who believe it’s ok to sing an 18th Century song about never being enslaved, written when the UK was enslaving and killing millions of innocents, also believe it’s appropriate for neo-Nazis to shout, ‘We will never be forced into a gas chamber.’ #RuleBritannia,” the BBC producer wrote on social media.

Lewis explained that she believes “slavery was Britain’s holocaust. We should apologise for it properly and yet at the moment, we have NO memorial to enslaved people in the UK. We should not celebrate slave owners.”

“We should not sing in a gloating way that Britons will never be enslaved, when we were responsible for enslaving so many. We should have anthems which celebrate what is truly great about the UK, which we can all sing and this will help unite our country,” she went on to write.

The woke screed from the BBC producer was met with furious outrage on social media, with many correcting her version of ‘history’.

“Britannia helped end slavery! This song rightly marks that,” Former Brexit Party MEP Martin Daubney declared, adding that Ms Lewis needs “a history lesson”.

Indeed, following the passage of the Act for the Abolition of the Slave Trade in 1807, the Royal Navy, specifically the West Africa Squadron, captured an estimated 1,600 slave trade ships, freeing some 150,000 African slaves in the process.

Between 1830 and 1865 some 1,587 British sailors lost their lives in their fight against slavery.

Lewis responded: “The song was written in 1740 & up to the end of the 18th century, millions were enslaved Martin Daubney. Yes, I’m also very proud Britain ended slavery in the 19th Century, but this song is not about that.”

Again Ms Lewis’ myopic view of British history was dispelled by Daubney, who noted that: “For 300 years Barbary Pirates from North Africa frequently plundered our shores for slaves. The Royal Navy fought back – hence in 1740 Rule Britannia roared “Britons never never never shall be slaves”.

‘Rule Britannia’ is ‘Racist Propaganda’ Says Black Studies Professor Kehinde Andrews https://t.co/XdKhyTQNIh — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) August 24, 2020

The outlandish attacks on British patriotism and history from the BBC producer came after the publicly-funded broadcaster announced its decision to remove the lyrics of Rule, Britannia! and Land of Hope and Glory from The Last Night of the Proms, amid pressure from Black Lives Matter supporters.

Responding to the decision, Foreign Office minister James Cleverly wrote on Tuesday: ‘I’m black. My mum was black. I have black family. I have black friends. I have black colleagues. I have black constituents. Number of times that the Last Night of the Proms was raised with me as an issue before this BBC nonsense? Zero.”

The Deputy Chairwoman of the European Research Group and MP for Morley and Outwood, Andrea Jenkyns, also took aim at the “woke agenda” of the BBC.

‘The BBC’s metropolitan managers have been looking for any excuse to pursue their woke agenda,” she told the Daily Mail.

“Patriotic songs are a huge part of British culture, and coming together to enjoy them as part of events such as St George’s Day is traditional in communities around the country,” she explained.

“I totally support upholding those traditions. I’ll continue singing them, as I have for many years,” Jenkyns pronounced.

Hollywood stars took their knives out for the Trump-supporting women who spoke during the third night of the Republican National Convention, singling out Kayleigh McEnany, Kellyanne Conway, Karen Pence, Marsha Blackburn, and even Catholic nun Sister Deirdre Byrne for mean-girl attacks and insults.

Celebrities including Mia Farrow, Alyssa Milano, and professional Trump haters Rosie O’Donnell and Kathy Griffin launched their social media attacks Wednesday evening as the RNC paid tribute to women who have made a mark on U.S. history, including Susan B. Anthony and the suffragettes who secured women’s right to vote.

Mia Farrow insulted Trump-supporting women by saying they all look alike and resemble “Barbies.”

The series is set to star British girl band star Leigh-Anne Pinnock.

The series, entitled, MTV Generation Change: Black Lives Matter, will star Pinnock, a member of the pop group Little Mix, as well as activist model Munroe Bergdorf, singer-songwriter Ray BLK, reality TV star Nathan Henry, model Duckie Thot, rapper Serious Klein, and others as the series rolls on, Variety reported.

MTV claims the series will tackle “issues” faced by blacks in the U.K. and presumably elsewhere. The series is expected to debut on MTV International’s social platforms on Aug. 26, as well as U.K. broadcast Channel 5 and BET International. A short introduction video for the project depicts several of the stars noting that just because they are rich and famous, that doesn’t mean they don’t experience racism.

Watch below:

Early this month, Pinnock told the U.K. press that the first time she experienced racism was when she was nine years old. Pinnock claimed that a white boy in her primary school class wrote her name on a piece of paper and then added. “Nationality: Jungle” to the scrawling.

“‘I saw it, and my heart just dropped. I knew it was racism,” she said.

Black Lives Matter marches have broken out in the United Kingdom and have turned violent, descending into chaos similar in scale to those in the U.S.

Little Mix has been a successful chart-topping group in the U.K. having sold nearly 16 million singles there. The latest album, 2018’s LM5, became their fifth top five charting album in Britain. The band has made little headway in the U.S. market, though. MTV has also commissioned more Generation Change episodes focusing on climate change, healthcare, equality, and other typical issues.

“Well, all hell has broken loose because I said Melania ‘still can’t speak English’ last night,” tweeted Bette Midler in reaction to the backlash she faced for claiming that Melania Trump can’t speak English. “I was wrong to make fun of her accent.

“Because the President is a Racist, White Supremacists are encouraged to kill Black people,” Rob Reiner warned his some 1.2 million Twitter followers. “Because the President is Incompetent 180,000 Americans are dead.”

It is not clear who Reiner was referring to as white supremacists. He constantly uses the term. Reiner’s remarks come as left-wing violence continues to plague parts of the country, months after the Black Lives Matter protests began in response to the death of George Floyd in police custody.

Of course, there is no actual pandemic of police violence against unarmed black people. As recently noted by USA Today, the “number of unarmed Black shooting victims is down 63% from 2015, when the database began, There are about 7,300 Black homicide victims a year. The 14 unarmed victims in fatal police shootings would comprise only 0.2% of that total.”

As for what President Donald Trump is encouraging, it can be summed up by Trump’s oft-tweeted phrase: “Law and Order.”

On Tuesday, the Kansas City Police Department even revealed that violent crime has decreased by more than 30 percent since Operation LeGend, the federal task force created by the Trump administration to reduce violent crime, that began last month in response to the death of four-year-old LeGend Taliferro, who died from a stray bullet back in June.

Just this week, Rob Reiner claimed that the Republican Party platform for this year’s presidential election is centered around “white supremacy” and letting Americans die from the Chinese coronavirus.

“The GOP has finalized its 2020 platform: Allow Donald Trump to continue to promote White Supremacy, reject Science, cozy up to Dictators, commit Federal Crimes, and let Americans die,” he declared, again, with no evidence, ahead of the Republican National Convention (RNC), which began on Monday. “Oh, and yes continue to be a fucking Sociopathic Ignoramus.”

Thorne has racked up $1 million within the first 24 hours of creating her OnlyFans account, becoming the first user to make that much money in their first day on the platform, according to a report by Page Six.

While OnlyFans’ top users are mainly sex workers and porn stars, other celebrities who have made accounts on the platform — such as rapper Cardi B — insist that they are using it solely for sharing exclusive personal content with their fans.

“NO I WONT BE SHOWING PUSSY , TITTIES AND ASS .LINK IN BIO…It will be a place for only me and my fans,” Cardi B told her fans earlier this month, according to a report by Complex.

The report added that, unlike Cardi B, Thorne is not completely opposed to sharing suggestive and adult content, and even asked her fans in a recent poll if they would like to see content that included tongue teasing, lingerie, booty, showering, and twerking.

Last week, Thorne announced that she had joined the platform by posting a montage video of herself on her Instagram account, which included clips of her wearing a bikini and a necklace that spelled “sex.”

The actress told the Los Angeles Times that she is on the platform, in part, for research related to a role for an upcoming film.

“It’s a feature we are researching as I’m living it currently,” she said. “What are the ins and outs? What does a platform like this do to its users? What’s the connective material between your life and your life inside the world of OnlyFans? … How can it change your life for the worse and the better? How far are you willing to go, and how far do you WANT to go? You can be me, or this talented girl from Montana, and OnlyFans could change your life — if you want it to, of course.”

After being on the platform for what is now nearly a week, Thorne has made roughly $2 million from her page, which offers her fans exclusive content for a subscription of $20 per month, according to Complex.

Last year, Thorne boasted about yelling at pro-life activists, proclaiming, “fuck these guys.”

“Just yelled at these abortion protesters, fucking fuck, fuck these guys,” she said.

The “United to Save the Vote” gala, slated for Sunday, August 30, is organized by nonpartisan organization RepresentUs. Despite presenting the virtual gala as a “fiercely nonpartisan” event, several high-profile anti-Trump celebrities are expected to participate. Those include Lawrence a RepresentUs board member, Sarah Silverman, and George Lopez.

Other celebrity participants include Helms, who is hosting the event, as well as Hillary Clinton 2016 campaign headliner Dave Matthews, Zooey Deschanel, George Lopez, Secretary Tom Ridge, Sia, Jake Johnson, Kenan Thompson, Drunk History, Nick Kroll, Ben Harper, Jonathan Scott, Kenny G, “and more,” according to the event page.

Organizers hope to raise $2 million to “ensure every American can vote safely and securely in November.”

“It’s critical we meet our goal; time is of the essence. The more donations we secure for VoteSafe, the better our shot at achieving these goals,” the event page reads.

While organizers aim to “ensure” absentee voting and “safe” in-person voting locations, they also list increasing trust in mail-in voting as one of their primary objectives. They also hope to “make sure that every single vote is counted and that everyone knows it will take a week – not a day – to get results.”

Roughly 75 percent of Americans will be able to vote by mail in November’s election, as Breitbart News reported:

In nine states, along with Washington D.C., registered voters will be mailed a ballot before the election. Voters in 33 states will be allowed to cast an absentee ballot with no excuse needed. In eight states, voters will be mailed an application to request an absentee ballot. In 25 states, voters are required to obtain an application for an absentee ballot themselves. In another eight states, voters will be required to have an excuse, other than coronavirus, to vote absentee. Critics have pointed to the continued flaws in mass vote-by-mail as Democrats continue to push their longhand party objective, using the Chinese coronavirus as a means to their end.

A recent NPR report revealed that over half a million mail-in ballots, 550,000, were rejected nationwide in the 2020 primary, compared to the 318,728 ballots rejected in the 2016 general election.

Despite the mounting evidence that mass mail-in voting increases the risk of fraud and error, Democrats continue to push their cries for mass mail-in voting. Two Democrat Super PACs are launching a multi-million dollar campaign to encourage mail-in voting. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) went so far as to call President Trump and his allies “enemies of the state” over their criticisms of vote-by-mail.

“We take an oath to protect and defend the Constitution from all enemies, foreign and domestic. And sadly, the domestic enemies to our voting system and honoring our Constitution are right at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue with their allies in the Congress of the United States,” she said during a Monday appearance on MSNBC’s Live.

“They’re doing everything they can, suppress the vote with their actions, scare people, intimidate by saying law enforcement will be there, diminish the role of the postal system and all of this,” she added. “It’s shameful, enemies of the state.”","Dave Matthews, Jennifer Lawrence, Ed Helms Headlining Virtual Celebrity Gala to ‘Increase Trust in Mail-in Voting’",fake

Cardi B recently conducted an interview with Joe Biden for Elle magazine in which she asked for free college and health insurance for everyone. Biden said that if he wins the election in November, he would implement these these giveaways and pay for them through taxes.

The rapper was a supporter of Bernie Sanders but shifted her allegiance to Joe Biden after the Vermont senator dropped out of the presidential race.

Melania Trump settled defamation lawsuits against the Daily Mail in 2017 after the tabloid ran a story speculating whether she worked as an escort before meeting President Trump. The first lady also sued Maryland-based author Webster G. Tarpley for libeling her when he called her a prostitute. The lawsuit was also settled for an undisclosed sum.

Office for National Statistics (ONS) figures, based on outgoing International Passenger Survey (IPS) estimates which likely understate the true scale of the influx, indicate that “715,000 people moved to the UK (immigration) and around 403,000 people left the UK (emigration)” over the period, with EU migrants down from their peak but arrivals still outstripping departures by 58,000.

The major driver of demographic change, however, comes from non-EU migrants — which, unlike EU migration, the British government has always been able to control, for the most part.

Non-EU migration over the year was an astonishing 437,000, with 121,000 leaving the UK for a net influx of 316,000 –“[one] of the highest levels seen since International Passenger Survey (IPS) records began for this group in 1975,” according to the ONS.

“The latest net migration figures from the ONS are shocking, if not surprising,” commented Alp Mehmet, chairman of the migration-sceptic Migration Watch UK think tank.

“The record level of net non-EU migration is an indication of the scale of the problem and what the government needs to control and reduce. The proposed points-based system will do nothing of the sort; if anything, the inflow of migrants from around the world will increase,” he added.

Migration Watch UK has long proposed that Boris Johnson’s plan to introduced an “Australian-style points-based immigration system”, long demanded by the likes of Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage and the Conservative Party’s own grassroots supporters, will in fact only exacerbate Britain’s mass immigration problem, as it is missing the Australian system’s key feature: an annual cap on the total inflow.

It is possible that this is a feature of the new policy rather than a bug, however, as despite the Conservative Party’s frequent employment of pro-borders messaging, few in its upper echelons are actually opposed to mass immigration.

Indeed, former chancellor George Osborne revealed in 2017 that “[N]one of [the Cabinet’s] senior members” supported a long-standing but never achieved party pledge to reduce net immigration “from the hundreds of thousands to the tens of thousands” in private, “and all would be glad to see the back of something that has caused… such public grief.”

Scrapping the “tens of thousands” pledge was one of Boris Johnson’s first acts as Prime Minister.

The foreign minister of France, Jean-Yves Le Drian, immediately criticized the proposed investigation for its lack of transparency.

Reuters reported “the transportation unit of the Siberian branch of the Interior Ministry” would conduct the investigation, which is not quite what international observers and Navalny allies had envisioned.

The investigators have already announced they have “inspected the hotel room where Navalny had been staying in Tomsk and the routes he had taken in the city, as well as analysed video surveillance footage from the area,” and found no evidence of “drugs or other potent substances.”

Le Drian clearly signaled on Thursday that Russia’s investigative efforts thus far are insufficient, and said the European Union will discuss taking further steps late next week.

“I don’t understand why the Russians aren’t playing the transparency game because it is in their interest,” Le Drian said in a radio interview.

“It’s a crime. Russia needs to take the initiative to carry out a transparent investigation, and when the guilty are found to use it a lesson,” he elaborated.

“It’s not the first time there is a poisoning,” Le Drian added darkly.

The French Foreign Minister suggested Moscow could save itself a good deal of trouble, and perhaps even earn some sanctions relief, by launching a more thorough and transparent investigation.

“We have some sanctions already in place so I think if they were to take the initiative of transparency it would be to their credit,” he said.

The Kremlin indicated on Thursday that no further investigation is coming.

“Here, in this case, nothing has changed. We still, unfortunately, do not have an understanding of what caused the condition the patient is in now,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Thursday, evidently misunderstanding that the point of an investigation is to achieve understanding.

Navalny spokeswoman Kira Yarmysh, the comatose opposition leader’s fiercest advocate and a fellow passenger aboard the Siberia-Moscow flight where he took ill, erupted on Thursday after Russian state television floated a theory that Navalny got sick after consuming an energy drink.

The TV station in question just happens to belong to Yevgeny “Putin’s Chef” Prigozhin, the close Kremlin ally who hates Navalny so much that he recently purchased the debt from a court decision against Navalny just so he can have the pleasure of personally bankrupting the man.

“It’s a lie. Alexey didn’t drink an energy drink. And I didn’t talk about it,” Yarmysh said on Thursday about the energy drink story.

Moscow’s conspiracy theories about Navalny’s predicament – including a theory floated by President Vladimir Putin that Navalny was poisoned in a false-flag operation by agents of a hostile foreign power he did not name – are based on the assertion that Putin would gain nothing by killing or incapacitating Navalny, dismissed by Putin’s allies as a loudmouthed pest discredited by court decisions who poses no real threat.

Reuters on Thursday quoted some Russian analysts and Navalny allies who strongly disputed that characterization, arguing that Navalny retains enough influence to make his “smart voting” strategy – in essence, voting strategically for the strongest opposition candidates, even if the elections are rigged so Putin cannot lose – and anti-corruption investigations a real problem for the authoritarian Russian president.

Even a “source close to the Kremlin,” who sought to minimize Navalny as an annoyance, admitted to Reuters that he might be irreplaceable. “He is bright, young, handsome, famous, has found his own style … when will the same appear? Not soon,” the source said.",Russia Finally Announces Probe into 'Illness' of Dissident Alexei Navalny,fake

A lawsuit has been brought against the concrete firm Formbetong by the Swedish building workers’ union Bynggnads and alleges that the company has exploited foreign workers paying as little as 96 Swedish kronor (£8.34/$10.96) on average for over 337,000 hours.

“I would call it modern slavery. It’s the tip of the iceberg, it’s never been as dirty as the industry is now before,” Torbjörn Hagelin of the construction union told broadcaster SVT.

According to the broadcaster, two Estonian-Russian migrant workers, who did not wish to identify themselves in case of reprisal, said they had been forced to work 15, 18 or even 24-hour shifts by the company. “We can say that we worked until we broke down,” a former employee stated.

Byggnads, meanwhile, said that the company violated the collective agreement with the workers and is looking for 25 million kronor (£2.17/$2.85 million) in damages.

“This has been going on for a long time, it’s a discrimination against these workers,” Hagelin said.

Elsewhere in Europe, migrant modern slavery has also been a major issue in recent months, including in the UK where it was revealed that the city of Leicester alone is alleged to contain up to 10,000 people working in modern slave-like conditions.

Former Conservative Party leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith commented on the report, which claimed there were up to 100,000 modern-day slaves in the UK, saying, “Too many migrants are then forced into slavery in disgusting conditions.”\

“They used to smuggle drugs and alcohol, but now smuggle and exploit vulnerable migrants — a much lower risk.

The victory by Sir Ed over the radical Layla Moran means now Britain’s much diminished and aggressively anti-Brexit Liberal Democrats — who have stumbled from defeat to defeat in recent years — joins the left-wing Labour party in being led by a legitimate knight.

Sir Keir Starmer became the leader of the Labour party earlier this year and is working to present a more mainstream, centre-left face after years of the hard-left Jeremy Corbyn — although Sir Keir has in fact elevated controversial figures such as Naz Shah, who has a history of sharing antisemitic material online and who once caused a furore after ‘liking’ a social media post suggesting grooming gang victims “need to shut their mouths. For the good of diversity” to leadership positions within the party.

Sir Ed was knighted in 2016 after he was a Cabinet minister in the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government under David Cameron. Sir Keir was knighted in 2014 after he stood down as the Director of Public Prosecutions, a senior legal position.

The knighthood ceremony involves being invited to a formal event at a palace, where a senior Royal — typically the Queen herself or one of her heirs — uses a sword tapped on the shoulders to confer the title.

It is unlikely the irony of the situation will be lost on the Conservatives — often derided by the left as being the party of the wealthy and out of touch — who stand alone among the traditional ‘major’ parties in Westminster in having a commoner leader.

‘When I say Bollocks to Brexit, I Mean it’: New Leader of Liberal Democrats Vows to Keep Britain In EU https://t.co/DBme02um1Z — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) July 22, 2019

The last time two British parties had leaders with titles at the same time may have been as far back as 1896, when the Conservative statesman Lord Salisbury — still today regarded as a giant of conservatism — and the Earl of Rosebery of the Liberals led their respective parties. Several other titled individuals have led political parties since, including former wartime leader Sir Winston Churchill in 1955 and Conservative leader Sir Alec Douglas-Home in 1964.

The globalist-centrist Liberal Democrats have been much keener on titled leaders in recent years, including Sir Menzies Campbell in 2007 and Sir Vince Cable in 2019.

Sir Ed Davey saw off competition from Layla Moran over the course of this year’s Liberal Democrat leadership election after the previous leader Jo Swinson suffered the humiliation of losing her own parliamentary seat in the December 2020 general election. The BBC reports Sir Ed has pledged to make the party “relevant” again after a precipitous decline in recent years.

The party had branded itself the party of Remain, launching several anti-Brexit stunts including its Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) — when Britain was still a full member of the European Union — wearing “Bollocks to Brexit” t-shirts in the debating chamber and inviting top EU figures to Britain to campaign on their behalf.

The party eventually backed down on revoking Brexit after it became clear how unpopular the policy was at the ballot box.

The report from the mass-migration sceptic think tank said that one year after the prime minister warned illegal migrants that the government “will send you back”, increasing waves of illegal migration have beset the United Kingdom.

According to the latest BBC estimate, approximately 4,200 illegal migrants have arrived in the UK since the start of the year by crossing the English Channel in small rubber boats from France. Since the beginning of last year, only 155 boat migrants have successfully been deported.

Upon arriving in the UK, most illegal migrants put in claims for asylum status to remain in the country, the report found.

The main issue Migration Watch UK highlighted in the report seen by Breitbart London is the so-called “pull factors” for migrants attempting to reach the UK, saying that “for many illegal entrants, getting to the UK is a no-lose option”.

One of the main factors is the inability or unwillingness on the part of the government to deport fraudulent asylum seekers and illegal migrants, as well as the massive subsidies handed out to migrants awaiting their asylum claim to be processed.

Based on figures from the National Audit Office (NAO), the report assessed that there are currently some 150,000 asylum seekers in the country, including those who had their claims rejected and have not been deported by the government.

Migration Watch UK pointed out that the number of so-called asylum seekers in the country is about twice the size of the full-time British Army.

“The government have lost control of illegal immigration across the Channel. As well as deterring people from setting out, they must address the pull factors. A major review is essential, including revision of the law on payments to asylum seekers,” said Chairman of Migration Watch UK Alp Mehmet.

The report found that over the past few years, the UK has taken in triple the number of asylum seekers from European nations than were sent back to the EU under the Dublin Regulation.

It also found that the majority of migrants making illegal boat crossings of the Channel were Iranian, making up 57 per cent of all illegals. This was followed by Iraqi and Syrian nationals. However, the report noted that migrants hailing from African nations such as Chad, Sudan, Eritrea, and Egypt were increasingly making the illegal journey.

Asylum seekers who are eligible are “immediately” whisked off to one of the 4,000 rooms in hotels across the country, where they are provided accommodation at the expense of the British taxpayer.

There are currently an estimated 48,000 migrants are being housed in the UK at taxpayers’ expense. Aside from free housing, asylum seekers are also given free access to the National Health Service (NHS), dental and eyesight care, free education for their children, and a weekly stipend of £37.75 to £39.60 per week.

It is estimated that the British taxpayer will pay at least £4 billion to fund these migrant programmes by the end of the decade.

The Home Office has admitted that there has been an ‘increase in abuse’ of the asylum process, with many immigration case-workers just receiving two weeks of training, and they often quit within the first six months of their employment.

An anonymous case-worker quoted in the report said that those deciding on asylum claims will sometimes take the “easiest” route to make a decision on an asylum claim “homing in on just one reason rather than considering whether the whole story adds up”.

“In this case, the application is likely to be approved, when perhaps it shouldn’t be,” the case-worker admitted.

This is compared to just 21 per cent who feel illegal migration is “not serious”, 13 per cent who say it is not “very serious”, and eight per cent who think that it is “not serious at all”.

Opinions on illegal migration still largely fall along partisan lines, with 97 per cent of Conservative voters seeing the issue as a serious concern, as opposed to Labour voters, of which 49 per cent see it as a serious to 45 per cent who do not.

Commenting on the poll, Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage said on Friday: “These figures show how out of touch our politicians are. Mainstream media even more clueless. People care about this issue.”

Professor of Politics in the School of Politics and International Relations at the University of Kent, Matthew Goodwin, said in response to the poll that “immigration has fallen down the list in British politics since Brexit. It might be about to climb back up.”

So far this year, an estimated 4,500 illegal migrants have been recorded to have successfully reached Britain by crossing the English Channel. However, the true number is most likely much higher, as it only reflects those actually caught. The Home Office has also stopped publishing the number of migrants under the age of 18, further driving down the figure.

The YouGov poll also found that over two-thirds of the British public are in favour of using the Royal Air Force (RAF) and the Royal Navy to combat illegal immigration, which has been described by Nigel Farage as an “invasion”.

As a whole, 69 per cent of Brits are in favour of RAF planes assisting the Border Force, with 71 per cent saying they would support the government sending the Royal Navy into the Channel to prevent illegal migrants from sailing from France.

While Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s administration has sent RAF planes to the Channel, the government has yet to deploy the Royal Navy to deter crossings. The idea of sending naval vessels to the Channel has drawn considerable push back from the French, with the mayor of Calais claiming that it would be tantamount to declaring “maritime war”.

The UK has been trying to reach an agreement with France that would see illegals immediately returned to France, as opposed to the current state of affairs, which typically sees the French Navy escort migrants into British territorial waters and hand them over to UK Border Force, who takes them ashore and allows the illegal migrants to claim for asylum.

So far, there has been no indication that the French will agree to a deal that would see migrants sent back to the safe, first world, and wealthy country, where, under international law, asylum seekers must remain.

A separate poll conducted by Redfield & Wilton Strategies for iNews found that the vast majority of Brits also feel that illegal boat migrants should not be allowed to stay in the UK, with 63 per cent in favour of their removal opposed to 21 per cent that said they should be able to stay.

“Those of us who remember the conclusion of the Far East campaign, whether on active service overseas, or waiting for news at home, will never forget the jubilant scenes and overwhelming sense of relief.

The radical Islamic terrorist, 23, was convicted of 22 counts of murder for organising the attack on the Ariana Grande concert with his brother in March, having been extradited from Libya to stand trial.

The Abedis’ father, a member of the Salafi jihadist Libyan Islamic Fighting Group, came to Britain as a refugee, but returned with his family after Colonel Muammar Gaddafi’s overthrow in a botched Western intervention championed by Barack Obama and David Cameron.

The brothers were brought to Britain by the Royal Navy in an evacuation operation in 2014 as the North African country descended into warlordism, allowing Salman to carry out his attack — although Hashem ultimately made his way back again.

“The stark reality is these were atrocious crimes; large in scale, deadly in intent, appalling in their consequences,” sentencing judge Jeremy Baker said of the Manchester murders, saying Hashem Abedi was “equally culpable” as his suicide bomber brother for the attack.

“The despair and desolation of the bereaved families has been palpable,” Baker added — although Abedi himself was not present for either the victim impact statements or sentencing in court, having refused to leave his cell.

It is not known if he will be subject to contempt of court proceedings for his actions.

Abedi could not be given a whole-life sentence, according to the judge and prosecutors, as Labour era legislation which the Conservatives have not changed prohibits such sentences for convicts under the age of 21 at the time of their crimes, and Abedi was a few months shy of his 21st birthday when the Manchester bombing took place.

He will not necessarily be released after 55 years, as it will be open to the authorities to deny his parole.

However, the Parole Board has released people convicted of shocking crimes before, such as triple child murderer David ‘The Monster of Worcester’ McGreavy, who was freed in 2019 without the mother of his victims being consulted.

The move came after President Donald Trump’s decision to draw down forces in Germany, over the country’s failures to meet its NATO spending requirements.

The Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement was signed by Pompeo and Polish Defence Minister Mariusz Błaszczak. The agreement will give U.S. armed forces greater access to Polish military infrastructure and will create a framework for a sharing of costs between the two nations for the American military presence.

The agreement will also lay the groundwork for a redeployment of American troops to Poland from Germany.

In a statement from the White House, President Donald Trump said: “The agreement will enhance our military cooperation and increase the United States’s military presence in Poland to further strengthen NATO deterrence, bolster European security, and help ensure democracy, freedom, and sovereignty.”

“This is going to be an extended guarantee: a guarantee that in case of a threat our soldiers are going to stand arm-in-arm,” Polish President Andrzej Duda said at the signing ceremony.

“It will also serve to increase the security of other countries in our part of Europe,” the Polish leader said.

“The opportunities are unlimited, the resources will be available,” Pompeo said at a news conference alongside Polish Foreign Minister Jacek Czaputowicz.

Germany claims Trump’s troop withdrawal hurts the NATO alliance, despite the country failing to meet its own spending requirements https://t.co/PTxPGkIALR — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) June 16, 2020

At present, there are some 4,500 American troops stationed in Poland, with an additional 1,000 to be deployed to the Eastern European nation.

The move comes one month after President Trump announced a reduction in forces from Germany, pledging to relocate troops to other European countries, including Poland.

The Pentagon later confirmed that 12,000 U.S. troops would be moved out of Germany, of which 5,600 would be redeployed across the continent. Seven U.S. military commands will also be moved from Germany to Poland, including the headquarters of the U.S. Army V Corps.

Trump has long been critical of Germany for its failures to meet the spending requirements for members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). In 2014, all NATO members pledged to spend at least two per cent of their respective gross domestic products on defence spending by the year 2024.

According to the latest figures released from the military alliance, Germany — despite being the top economy in the EU — only spent 1.38 per cent of its GDP on defence in 2019. The country has said that it “hopes” to reach the spending target by 2031.

In an exclusive interview with Breitbart London, then-American Ambassador to Germany, Richard Grenell, said that Germany has been “woeful” in living up to its commitments to NATO.

“Germany is the largest economy in Europe. They made a commitment to NATO, and they should be serious about that commitment; it is a multilateral institution that guarantees the allies, guaranteeing freedom,” Grenell said in 2018.

Poland, on the other hand, is one of the few NATO countries in Europe to meet its spending obligations.

In 2018, the ambassadors from the United States and Poland wrote a joint statement, celebrating the deep ties between the two nations and hailing the “shared democratic ideals are the heart of our 100-year-old friendship… [T]he bond between the United States and Poland is stronger than ever, and we are ready to face the next 100 years together.”

The NCA, roughly equivalent to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in the United States, announced that ten people aged between 35 and 53 had been arrested in Rotherham “on suspicion of offences relating to the abuse of girls who would have been between aged between 11 and 16 at the time [of the abuse].”

This followed the arrest of five men in Rotherham and Leeds between July 28th and July 30th, with another suspect being detained last week — all as part of the Operation Stovewood investigation into grooming offences which took place between 1997 and 2013, launched in response to the Alex Jay inquiry into the mismanagement of such crimes by the authorities.

The NCA said that “around 150 people have now been arrested as part of Operation Stovewood” and that “Jail terms of almost 250 years have been handed down to the 20 people convicted so far” — although this is somewhat misleading, given 250 years averages just 12.5 years across 20 people, and criminals in Britain are in any case typically released early on licence automatically at the halfway point or, more rarely, the tw0-thirds point in their sentences.

“This has been a significant week of operational activity and, working closely with local partners in Rotherham and across Yorkshire, we continue to focus on supporting victims and bringing offenders to justice as part of Operation Stovewood,” commented Philip Marshall, Operation Stovewood senior investigating officer.

“While that work goes on it is important we still reach out and appeal to victims or witnesses to come forward,” he continued.

“We’re interested in speaking to anyone who might have information to help investigations into child sexual abuse in Rotherham between 1997 and 2013.

Greek media, meanwhile, have said that Turkish claims of an attack were fake news. They added that while a Greek frigate had a collision with a Turkish vessel this week, the damage to Greece’s ship was minor despite alternative claims by the Turkish press that there had been extensive damage.

Cavusoglu also warned the French government over a potential escalation of tensions in the Eastern Mediterranean after French President Emmanuel Macron announced France would be strengthening its naval presence in the area, citing Turkish behaviour.

“The situation in the Eastern Mediterranean is worrying. Turkey’s unilateral decisions on oil exploration are causing tensions,” Macron wrote on Twitter in Greek and French.

Mr Macron added: “I have decided to temporarily strengthen the French military presence in the Eastern Mediterranean in the coming days, in cooperation with European partners, including Greece.”

For the past five days, the Greek and Turkish navies have been engaged in a game of brinkmanship in waters between the Greek island of Crete, Cyprus and Turkey over offshore drilling rights. That followed Ankara’s deployment of a seismic research vessel to prospect for potential oil and gas reserves in waters that Athens claims are located over Greece’s continental shelf.

Cyprus and Greece are EU members, while Turkey is not. Josep Borrell, the 27-nation bloc’s foreign policy chief, tweeted after the end of the talks: “Eastern Med: Full solidarity (with) Greece&Cyprus. Calling for immediate de-escalation by Turkey and reengaging in dialogue.”

Greek Foreign Minister Nikos Dendias, who also met in Vienna with U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, said he was “pleased” with the solidarity expressed by his country’s EU partners and their “condemnation of Turkey’s illegal behaviour.”

“Turkey is the only (party) responsible for the escalation of tension in the eastern Mediterranean, and it must immediately leave the Greek continental shelf,” Dendias said after Friday’s talks. “That is a necessary precondition for de-escalation.”

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Turkey would press ahead with its prospecting until Aug. 23 as planned. But following a phone call with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, he signalled that Ankara and Berlin had agreed to a “softening” of positions after that date.

There was no indication from Athens whether it had been consulted, or had agreed, on the matter. Merkel had interceded to defuse a similar face-off between Greece and Turkey a few weeks ago.

Erdogan also warned that Turkey would strongly respond to any “harassment” of its vessels by Greece.

Dendias said Greece was open to talks with Turkey, “but obviously not while subject to pressure and blackmail.”

Relations between the historic regional rivals — and nominal NATO allies — have hit a more than two-decade low over the prospecting mission launched Monday.

Greece placed its armed forces on high alert and sent warships to the spot, demanding the vessels’ withdrawal. Turkey claims it has every right to prospect in the area, as well as in neighbouring waters Cyprus considers its own, after the discovery of large offshore gas deposits in recent years off Israel, Egypt and Cyprus.

With the warships dancing about each other in a relatively small patch of sea, there’s a real danger of rapid escalation in the case of an accidental collision or hostile act.

German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas, whose country holds the rotating EU presidency, said before the talks that “the provocations” that are happening in the eastern Mediterranean “can’t continue.”

“Nor can the Turkish drilling,” he said. “We are working toward a direct dialogue between the parties that would contribute to finding a solution for this issue.” Maas added that there should be no drilling during any negotiations.

Apart from backing from its EU partners, Athens is also seeking a commitment for potential EU sanctions against Turkey. Dendias said a list of possible sanctions is being drafted and will be discussed at the next foreign ministers’ meeting in Berlin later this month.

In a strong show of support this week, France pledged to boost its military presence in the eastern Mediterranean and sent two warships to the area Thursday for joint drills with the Greek navy. France also deployed two fighter planes to Crete.

French relations with Turkey, which is not an EU member, are already bad over Ankara’s involvement in Libya’s civil war.

French President Emmanuel Macron tweeted Friday that he spoke to U.S. President Donald Trump about the situation in the eastern Mediterranean, Libya and Lebanon.

“We share the same views. Peace and security in the region is in our common interest, which we will uphold,” Macron said.

Erdogan said that during his call with Merkel late Thursday, the German chancellor requested a “softening of the issue and to proceed in a more protective understanding.”

“We agreed,” Erdogan told reporters, adding that he hoped the Greek leadership would “reach the same point.”

Erdogan added: “We will not leave unanswered the slightest attack against our civilian ships.”

The Turkish leader also said his country had responded to an incident involving the Turkish research ship Oruc Reis.

Greek officials said they were unaware of any incident Thursday, and the Foreign Ministry said Dendias would brief his EU partners from Vienna on “the true events during recent days concerning operational incidents in the area.”

In Switzerland meanwhile, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said Turkey does not seek an escalation and called on the EU to convince Greece to act with “reason.” He also accused France of engaging in “bullying” in the eastern Mediterranean.

Two small groups of six migrants each were removed to France and Germany, with another 15 being removed in the last week, according to the BBC — but these numbers are dwarfed by the more than 5,000 known to have crossed the English Channel illegally in small boats since the beginning of 2020.

Even this figure almost certainly underestimates the true scale of the Channel crisis, however, as the British authorities have been refusing disclose the number of supposed child migrants who migrants who have been crossing — even though it has been admitted that at least a quarter of these are really adults.

It also fails to account for migrants who land undetected, or who reach Britain via more “traditional” cross-Channel routes — i.e. hiding in lorries and other vehicles, stowing away in ferries, or breaking into the Eurotunnel.

Nevertheless, even the small number of deportations Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Home Secretary Priti Patel have achieved have met with resistance, with some illegals detained at Brook House ahead of their removal organising a hunger strike in an effort to blackmail the authorities into letting them stay.

“I told the Home Office that I’d prefer to die here rather than going to Spain again,” said one migrant of the hunger strike, as quoted by the Detained Voiced anti-border control activist organisation.

They added that they were in Britain “looking for… a new life with new opportunities [and] reunion with my family” — although whether this referred to joining family members already in the country or family members they intended to bring over through chain migration once regularised is unclear.

The judiciary has proven to be the open borders lobby’s most potent weapon against deportations, however, with a Home Office social media video blaming “activist lawyers” and EU law — which still applies in Britain, as it has yet to exit its post-Brexit “transition period” with the bloc — for its failure to get on top of the problem.

“[C]urrent return regulations are rigid and open to abuse, allowing activist lawyers to delay and disrupt returns,” the government department complained.

“Soon we will no longer be bound by EU laws and can negotiate our own return arrangements,” they promised — suggesting Boris Johnson’s administration has no intention of taking firm action for months.

Even after EU law ceases to imply in Britain, however, the government would still have to stand up to France, European human rights judges — whose jurisdiction over Britain continues with or without Brexit — and anti-borders interpretations of international law in order to seriously step up removals.

As yet the government has offered little indication that it intends to do so.

Brexit leader Nigel Farage has urged the government to take action much sooner, saying in an interview this week that the nation should withdraw from the European Union’s Dublin III regulations on asylum seeking ahead of leaving the transition period at the end of December. Noting it could take months for the government to pass new legislation, Mr Farage said thousands more could come in that time.

He said: “But the problem is, how many thousands more will come, and need to be housed, and put pressure on those communities before anything passes into law. And I actually think that the government needs to say to the European Union as part of the negotiations that are ongoing — we are overriding the Dublin Regulations which allows people, effectively, to not claim asylum in France but to come to Britain. And we’ll overrule them immediately. That’s the only way we are going to stop the flow this year.”

1112,http://www.breitbart.com/health/2020/08/27/vatican-coronavirus-harbinger-of-future-crises-relating-to-climate-change/,2020-08-27T00:00:00,breitbart,"ROME — The Vatican released a joint document with the World Council of Churches (WCC) Thursday calling for greater attention to the environment in “a post-COVID-19 world.”

“The human misery associated with the COVID-19 pandemic is taking place amid the broader context of the suffering of this planet,” notes the text, which bears the title “Serving a Wounded World in Interreligious Solidarity: A Christian Call to Reflection and Action During COVID-19.”

The coronavirus health crisis can be seen as “a harbinger of future crises relating to climate change and the assault on biodiversity,” the document declares. “We urgently need an ecological conversion of attitudes and actions to care more effectively for our world, paying attention to the groaning of the creation.”

According to the Vatican website, the document is meant to offer “a Christian basis for interreligious solidarity that can inspire and confirm the impulse to serve a world wounded not only by COVID-19 but also by many other wounds.”

The text contains an entire section devoted to the virtue of “hope” but curiously omits any reference to hope in eternal life, but points only to “planetary responsibility” and a “better world.”

Whereas in the plagues of past centuries, the Christian churches embraced their mission of preparing souls for death and judgment, along with caring for their bodies, the current document is devoid of any mention of salvation or eternal life.

The document “recognizes the current context of the pandemic as a time for discovering new forms of solidarity for rethinking the post-COVID-19 world,” the Vatican states, but it fails to recognize the pandemic as an opportunity to reconsider human mortality and the distinct contribution of Christianity to understanding the meaning of earthly existence.

As a result, all of the recommendations offered to the faithful moving forward are immanent in nature, since a dimension of transcendence seems to have been intentionally excised from all consideration.

The text does make frequent reference to the gospel parable of the Good Samaritan and the need to care for one another.

“This parable challenges Christians to think about how to live in a world wounded by the COVID-19 pandemic, and by the scourge of religious intolerance, discrimination, racism, economic and ecological injustice and many other sins,” it declares.

To its credit, the joint declaration does recognize the far-reaching negative effects of global lockdowns, which extend far beyond the effects of the disease itself.

“Alongside the millions who have been infected physically, many more have been affected psychologically, economically, politically and religiously; all have been deprived of public worship,” the text notes.

“People have struggled to cope with death and grief, especially with the inability to be with their loved ones at their deathbeds, and perform their last rites and funerals in a dignified manner,” it adds.

“The lockdown has brought the world economy to its knees, and global hunger could double due to this catastrophe,” the document states. “It has also contributed to an increase in domestic violence. The requirements of physical and social distancing have meant isolation for many people. Despair, anxiety and insecurity have come to dominate human lives.”

The document concludes with a series of recommendations, including “bearing witness to suffering,” promoting a “culture of inclusivism,” nurturing “solidarity through spirituality,” teaching the clergy to “foster empathy,” and creating “spaces for dialogue.”

The ultimatum was spread across the Swiss town on dozens of posters that called on police to act against the problem of delinquency committed by mainly North African migrants.

“We are proud, organized and angry. We have the capacity to be dangerous for those who disturb social peace so much,” the poster said, according to a report from Swiss broadcaster Radio Télévision Suisse.

So far, police say they have not been able to identify those behind the poster campaign but say that on at least two occasions there have been violent attacks on migrants causing trouble in the city.

Georges-André Lozouet, communications officer for the Neuchâtel police labelled the posters as unacceptable saying, “No one can take the place of the police. We are in a democracy and the system is bearing fruit.”

The alleged fruit Lozouet referred to is an operation by police in the area which led to 184 arrests and targetted those engaging in thefts and assaults.

In 2018, residents on the Greek island of Lesbos, which has been a hotbed for mass migration for years, echoed similar sentiment according to the leader of the community on Moria at the time.

Nikos Trakellis explained the situation on the island and said, “We are all being duped here and in Europe. They’re making fun of us. The residents are ready to take the law into their own hands. We are trying to contain the local community, to preserve whatever social cohesion is left.”

While normally police do not condone vigilantes, earlier this month in Montpellier a police officer allegedly suggested the idea to residents of a so-called “vulnerable” no-go neighbourhood in the city in order to deal with local delinquency.

The gathering of political, financial, and social elites was due to discuss “the ‘Great Reset’ in the post-COVID-19 era” however this lead agenda item will also be pushed to a place and time yet to be determined.

The next WEF meeting had originally been scheduled for Jan. 25. The summit is typically held every January in the ski resort of Davos, Switzerland, a small town in the Swiss Alps, around 92 miles south-east of Zurich.

The forum said the soonest the 2021 summit could occur is “early next summer.” The move to reschedule comes as the global death toll from coronavirus surpasses 820,000, with the caseload approaching 24m.

“The decision was not taken easily, since the need for global leaders to come together to design a common recovery path and shape the ‘Great Reset’ in the post-COVID-19 era is so urgent,” WEF spokesman Adrian Monck said in a statement.

“However, the advice from experts is that we cannot do so safely in January.”

The Davos meeting has long been seen as a playground for the global elite. In the past it has featured at least 40 heads of state and 2,500 top business executives at any one time, most choosing to fly in by private jet.

The forum’s 50th annual confab seven months ago included appearances by business figures including JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon and Hungarian-American philanthropist George Soros.

Former Vice President-turned-carbon billionaire Al Gore and rapper Pharrell Williams have also been notable attendees discussing global warming and recycling respectively.

How much does it cost to participate?

The WEF website reveals annual membership (required if you want to buy a ticket to Davos) is upwards of U.S.$60,000, depending on the institution or company’s “level of engagement”.

At the top are the 100 “strategic partner” companies – including Accenture, Barclays, Deloitte, KPMG and Unilever – who pay around U.S.$600,000 for annual membership, which entitles them to buy an access-all-sessions pass for themselves and five colleagues, including special privileges. But they still have to purchase actual tickets to the event.

The WEF, which is run as a not-for-profit organisation, said in its last annual report the Davos meeting generated 13 percent of its $378.5m revenues in 2019, warning a cancellation “could have negative consequences on the foundation’s revenue.”",Davos Despair: ‘Great Reset’ Meeting Postponed over Coronavirus Fears,fake

According to a report for the newspaper Il Giornale, the General welcomed recent moves from Sicilian Governor Nello Musumeci who signed an ordinance to close Sicily’s migrant hotspots after the island began to be overwhelmed in recent weeks with new arrivals who had to be quarantined due to the coronavirus.

“By 24 August, all migrants present in hotspots and in each reception centre must be… transferred and/or relocated to other facilities outside the Sicilian Region, since it is not possible to guarantee the stay in the island in accordance with the health measures of prevention of contagion,” Musumeci said.

According to General Santo, the Sicilian governor’s actions may not be enough to convince the leftist coalition government to change course. “But it could turn into a fundamental political signal,” he said.

Louise Anderson, from Stirling in Scotland, said that she wants to prevent the clinic from destroying the sperm in order to produce a grandchild, which she claims would be in alignment with her child’s wishes.

“As a teenager, she delayed hormone blockers to save her sperm to enable her to have her own biological children. She had made me promise that if anything were to happen to her, her children would be brought into the world,” Anderson told BBC Scotland.

“I am going to do everything I can to honour her wishes – not just for her but for anyone else who is caught in this position. It kind of sparked a little fire in my belly and I want to make her wishes come true,” the mother said.

Ellie — the deceased transgender teen– froze the sperm at the Glasgow Royal Infirmary Fertility Clinic at the age of 14. After that, the teen began taking female hormones. Ellie later died in Forth Valley Hospital after falling ill in.

The cause of death was characterised as “unascertained”.

Under the current legislation in the UK on human fertilisation, the mother of a sperm donor does not have the right to request the samples, a right which is only afforded to romantic partners of a deceased donor.

A fellow in medical ethics at the University of Edinburgh, David Obree said that the gender identity of Ellie is legally “irrelevant” in the case.

“The key question is, what did she intend the sperm to be used for? The question the court will need to look at is: did she specifically consent or request that her sperm be used by a third party?” he said.

The solicitor for the mother of the late trans teen, Virgil Crawford, said that the case presents an “unusual, interesting, important and complex legal issue”.

“What we’re trying to achieve would be to get an order from the court that Ellie’s mum would be entitled to make use of her sperm for the purpose that Ellie intended – that being to create a genetic child of hers and a grandchild for Ms Anderson,” Crawford said.

Navalny is currently receiving medical treatment in Germany, where doctors and government officials are among those who believe he was poisoned.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Wednesday his government “would not like” relations with the West to deteriorate over the Navalny case, and said there is “no reason” for international relations to suffer.

The odds are growing that Navalny’s plight will have international repercussions. Bloomberg News noted on Tuesday that more European leaders are calling for a full and transparent investigation, the German government is growing visibly exasperated with the Kremlin’s attitude, and the Trump administration has joined the chorus of concern:

Deeply concerned by reports that Russian opposition activist Aleksy Navalny was poisoned. If these reports are proven accurate, we support the EU's call for a comprehensive investigation. The U.S. stands ready to assist. — Secretary Pompeo (@SecPompeo) August 25, 2020

According to Peskov, Russian President Vladimir Putin “stressed the inadmissibility of hasty and unfounded accusations” about Navalny in a phone call with Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte on Wednesday afternoon. On Monday, the Kremlin accused German doctors of “rushing” to declare Navalny has toxins in his system.

“This is a Russian citizen who is in a coma and we want to find out what was the reason for this coma,” Peskov said.

“We are definitely interested, no less than others, in understanding what led to the coma of the patient who is undergoing treatment in a Berlin hospital,” he insisted. “[As for] various hasty wordings that are so abundantly used that this was poisoning with a high degree of probability, we are patient, but we strongly disagree with that at this stage.”

Peskov also made a discouraging reference to Russian parliamentary speaker Vyacheslav Volodin’s orders on Tuesday to begin investigating a conspiracy theory that Navalny was actually poisoned by “foreign states” in a false flag operation.

“The State Duma security committee will be instructed to analyze what happened in order to understand whether this was an attempt on the part of foreign states to harm the health of a Russian citizen to fuel tensions inside Russia, as well as to formulate fresh accusations against our country,” Volodin said.

Peskov on Wednesday agreed there is “reason to consider whom it benefits” if poison was found in Navalny’s system, clearly implying the Russian government could not possibly benefit from such an obvious effort to kill a leading critic.

Navalny himself has suggested Putin would be foolish to murder him because it would “turn him into a hero,” but Ivan Zhdanov, director of Navalny’s FBK anti-corruption investigative foundation, asserted on Wednesday that only Putin could have authorized an assassination attempt.

“He hates what the FBK does too much, exposing him and his entourage,” Zhdanov asserted.

Also less than fond of Navalny and his work is billionaire Yevgeny Prigozhin, known as “Putin’s chef” because of the catering services his company provides to the Kremlin. Prigozhin restated his determination on Tuesday to bankrupt Navalny and his foundation.

“I intend to strip this group of unscrupulous people of their clothes and shoes,” Prigozhin said.

“If comrade Navalny kicks the bucket, I personally don’t intend to persecute him in this world. I’ll put this off for an indefinite time and then I’ll compensate myself to my pleasure,” he said of the million-dollar defamation settlement Navalny and the FBK have been ordered to pay.

The settlement was imposed on Navalny for making supposedly slanderous accusations against a company that caters to Russian schools. Prigozhin has denied he secretly owns the company, but on Tuesday he ostentatiously paid the company off so that all the penalties paid by Navalny and the FBK will come to him personally.",Russia Hopes Relations with West Won’t Suffer over Navalny,fake

A total of 96 people were rescued from the sea 21 nautical miles (31 kilometers, 24 miles) west of the small island of Halki, near Rhodes, the coast guard said. As the total number of people who had been on board was not known, the search and rescue operation continued into Wednesday afternoon.

The coast guard described the effort as “one of the largest and most successful search and rescue operations to have taken place in the Aegean Sea,” noting that it took place mainly at night and that many of those rescued, including many children, had not been wearing life jackets.

Of those rescued, 72 were transported to Rhodes, five to the island of Karpathos and 19 were picked up from a cargo ship by the Turkish coast guard. Those taken to the Greek islands were being given coronavirus tests and were being housed in quarantine hotels.

Three of those rescued were arrested as suspected migrant smugglers, the coast guard said.

Authorities were alerted after a passenger on board the yacht made an emergency call late Tuesday.

They scrambled helicopters, naval and coast guard vessels, and several passing merchant ships also participated in the operation.

But Greece’s coast guard said its rescue efforts were hampered by the Turkish coast guard. The incident comes during a crisis in Greek-Turkish relations, with the two neighbors in an acrimonious dispute over maritime exploration rights in the eastern Mediterranean.

The coast guard said in a statement that two Turkish patrol vessels arrived in the search and rescue area during the overnight operation, after a “large number” of people had already been rescued.

The statement said the Turkish vessels did not notify the rescue operation coordinator about their presence and made no essential contribution to the effort. “Also, they were constantly calling on the nearby ships in the area to depart,” it said.

The Greek coast guard statement added that the Turkish patrol boats took 19 of the rescued migrants off a Maltese-flagged, Turkish-owned cargo ship that had picked them up, thereby hampering efforts to account for the number of rescued and determine whether there were people missing.

The Turkish coast guard issued its own statement Wednesday regarding a distress call 45 miles southwest of the Turkish coastal town of Datca. The statement said the coast guard sent three vessels to the area and rescued 18 migrants from a commercial ship, as well as one Turkish national who it said had been trying to leave Turkey. They were transferred to the Turkish port of Bodrum.

The Turkish coast guard statement did not mention the island of Halki or the Greek coast guard allegations, but the area it refers to suggests the incident described was the same one reported by Greece.

Thousands of people continue to make their way clandestinely to the Greek islands from the nearby Turkish coast, paying smugglers to ferry them in often unseaworthy, overcrowded inflatable dinghies or other vessels.

The Greek coast guard said smuggling gangs have recently begun using larger vessels, mainly sailboats and yachts, to ferry migrants from the Turkish coast directly to southern Italy. Such a route would mean the migrants would bypass Greece, where thousands languish in overcrowded camps instead of being able to head to their intended destination, usually more prosperous European countries further north.

At least 25 such incidents have occurred in the last three months, the coast guard said, adding that they had been handled by the Greek and the Italian coast guards.

In the now-deleted tweet, the MP for Bermondsey and Old Southwark wrote: “I have spent years warning local people that these fat old racists won’t stop blaming the EU when their sh*t hits the fan. Here they come blaming others. Absolute sh*tbag racist w*nkers.”

Mr Coyle was responding to a post from Leader of the House of Commons of United Kingdom Jacob Rees Mogg who wrote: “Britons must never be enslaved by political correctness,” after Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s condemned the “wetness” of the BBC for scrapping the lyrics of patriotic songs.

The Labour politician also reportedly wrote: “If you didn’t hate it before, feel free to hate the song now. I’ve never known anyone but sh*tlickers like it tbh,” according to the Huffington Post.



Former Brexit Party MEP Martin Daubney suggested that the Labour MP was “drunk-tweeting” saying: “You just ensured a bunch more people abandon the “kinder, gentler” party that Labour has become.”

“Stop the drunk-tweeting and seriously think about why the working classes have abandoned you [Labour],” he said.

Brexit campaigner and political commentator Darren Grimes added: “Were you drunk when you wrote this tweet with unparliamentary language? Or are you just looking down your nose at those of us who aren’t ashamed of British culture? Same old Labour.”

British-American comedian David Baddiel also took aim at the patriotic British song, calling it a “C*nts Anthem”, in reference to a video clip showing Brexit leader Nigel Farage proudly singing the tune with supporters.

There might be some who feel a little sad about Rule, Brittania, seeing it, now divorced of triumphalist origins, only as a Proms tradition. Watching this however makes it clear how it’s still basically a Cunts Anthem. https://t.co/iGxjHqdCDM — David Baddiel (@Baddiel) August 25, 2020

The decision to scrap the lyrics from the performance of Rule, Britannia! and Land of Hope and Glory came in part as a result from pressure from the Black Lives Matter movement in the UK, with the conductor of this year’s Last Night Orchestra — Finnish citizen Dalia Stasevska — reportedly being a “big supporter of Black Lives Matter”.

A BBC source told The Times on Tuesday that the left-leaning broadcaster’s upper management are a bunch of “white guys in a panic” when it comes to matters of race.

On Wednesday, the author of The Madness of Crowds and The Strange Death of Europe, Douglas Murray wrote in The Telegraph that he is “getting a little fed up with the shoe-horning of George Floyd into every aspect of our lives.”

“The Minnesotan policeman accused of killing him is currently in prison awaiting trial for murder. Literally nobody on earth is defending his actions. So it is slightly galling that anyone, at the BBC or anywhere else, should try to present his killing as some sort of Murder on the Orient Express effort involving every white person on earth,” Murray argued.

“Tens of thousands of members of the general public have already signed a petition to try to persuade the BBC that we know how to behave after a song or two. I hope they are successful. A country is made up of its traditions. This country is a decent one, and our traditions are too,” Murray concluded.

Turkey Claims Greece Attacked Research Vessel and Tells France to Back Off https://t.co/2EexqoQ9AV — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) August 15, 2020

Greece and Turkey have been at odds since last month when the Turkish research vessel Oruc Reis set sail for an area in the Mediterranean to conduct research. Greece countered the move by putting its armed forces on alert, while Turkey sent out several warships to escort the Oruc Reis.

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan even claimed the Greek navy “attacked” the research vessel, but the supposed attack was played down by Greek media who said there had been a minor collision between a Greek naval vessel and a Turkish vessel.

In recent weeks, France has also not only expressed concern over Turkish actions but French President Emmanuel Macron vowed to increase the French naval presence in the region.

Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu responded to Macron’s move by warning him not to escalate the situation even further.

So far the Turkish government has refused to back down on the issue and this week released a propaganda video that compares President Erdogan to Sultan Mehmet II of the Ottoman empire, with Greek newspaper Proto Thema claiming it displayed Erdogan’s “neo-Ottoman desires.”

The Hagia Sophia, which Erdogan recently converted into a mosque, is also shown prominently in the video along with depictions of the Turkish military from several eras, including the First World War.

The video ends with footage of the Al-Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem. After converting the Hagia Sophia, Erdogan released a statement in Arabic saying the “liberation” was the first step to “liberate” Al-Aqsa in Jerusalem.

Using SUV and carjacked cargo vehicles, cartel operators knocked down several light poles being used to hold up police cameras.

The incidents began on Tuesday morning and continued into Wednesday evening as cartel operators knocked down close to a dozen surveillance cameras in various parts of the city. Law enforcement sources consulted by Breitbart Texas revealed that the attacks come as a response to a series of raids by a special forces police unit. The raids netted several important seizures and forced several cartel commanders to go on the run.

As Breitbart Texas has reported, in Reynosa, Gulf Cartel operators set up their own clandestine network of surveillance cameras that provide the criminal organization with information about the movements of law enforcement and military forces in the region. When authorities discover such cameras, they remove them, in a similar fashion, cartel operators have in the past knocked down police surveillance cameras.

The tactic comes just days before Mexico’s President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador is expected to visit Reynosa. The border city is considered a bastion of the Gulf Cartel and sees large scale gun battles in a regular fashion. In contrast, home Lopez Obrador is widely criticized for his perceived soft approach in fighting drug cartels while previously claiming that the war on drugs was over.

An initial search by a K-9 and non-intrusive imaging system led officers to conduct a physical search of the trailer. During the search, the officers found 398.77 pounds of methamphetamine, officials reported.

This load had an estimated street value of $5,582,752, the report indicated.

In total, the officers seized 1,609.9 pounds of methamphetamine in the two shipments with an estimated value of more than $29.8 million.

The officers seized the drugs and turned the cases over to ICE Homeland Security Investigation special agents for further investigation and preparation of drug trafficking charges.

“The scope of methamphetamine abuse in the U.S. is on the rise,” said Acting Port Director Andrew Douglas, Laredo Port of Entry. “Seizures like these underscore the importance that CBP officers play in achieving our overall national border security mission and protecting the public from illegal narcotics.”","1,600 Pounds of Meth Seized in Two Shipments at Texas Border Crossing",fake

The discovery took place on Tuesday afternoon when, according to a statement from Mexico’s Army, troops were conducting routine patrols along the banks of the Rio Grande when they came across the entrance to the underground structure.

The tunnel is between the Arboledas and Pinos neighborhoods, a short distance from Veteran’s International Bridge. The location would place the U.S. entrance near Milpa Verde Street in Brownsville. Photographs provided by the military show the tunnel has wooden support beams and a makeshift power system. It remains unclear if the tunnel was still in use or if the military seized any drugs.

Matamoros is the birthplace of the Gulf Cartel which controls the drug and human smuggling operations from most of Tamaulipas into Texas. In recent years, the Gulf Cartel has gone through several internal rifts resulting in a dramatic rise in violence.

The discovery comes two days before Mexico’s President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador is expected to visit Matamoros. Military officials did not reveal if the patrolling was part of security measures linked to the presidential visit.

Since that time, war has raged.

Breitbart Texas recently obtained an intelligence report detailing how, in April 2020, the cartel used small airplanes to drop explosives on the civilian militias. Mexican authorities deployed aerial surveillance as a deterrent. The CJNG then transitioned to small drones able to fly undetected on conventional radar.

Recently, two drones were seized inside a CJNG armored vehicle located in Tepalcatepec. They were found abandoned after a failed attack. The drones were loaded with C-4 explosives and ball bearings capable of remote detonation.

The report also cites a Mexican Attorney General report of a previous seizure of three armed drones in Puebla, Guanajuato, where the CJNG planned to use their use on the Santa Rosa Del Lima Cartel.

Drones in cartel wars are nothing new. They first came to the battlefields by the Gulf Cartel first for surveillance tasks in 2013. More advanced capabilities later emerged with long-range flights and aftermarket optics. Today, all significant cartels are using some form of drones in defensive and offensive capabilities.

Drone use is referred to as third-dimension tactics. In this context, gunmen are learning a new craft as a precision weapon system.

More concerning are the cartels’ use of third-dimension tactics that go unnoticed by too many government agencies. Cartels have large budgets to cover the costs of drone technology advancements and have a proven track record of being early adopters of new battlefield tactics.

The allegations are made in a story by the New York Times where Michael D. Shear quoted two anonymous sources reportedly at a meeting between top officials from the Department of Homeland Security and Customs and Border Protection two weeks before the 2018 midterm elections. The weapon in question is called Active Denial System, “a ‘heat-ray’ designed by the military to make people’s skin feel like it is burning when they get within range of its invisible beams.”

At the time of the meeting in October 2018, the agencies that dealt with border security were swamped with caravans of Central American migrants, including a large portion of women and children seeking to file asylum claims. The rapidly growing number of migrants over several months overwhelmed detention facilities.

“Kirstjen Nielsen, then the Secretary of Homeland Security told an aide after the meeting that she would not authorize the use of such a device, and it should never be brought up again in her presence” the Times quoted an unnamed official.

According to the report, a spokesman from Homeland Security claimed the microwave weapon was never considered.

The agents found the man hiding on a train after he illegally re-entered the United States.

Bracketville Station Border Patrol agents received information from Union Pacific Railroad officials about an “unauthorized passenger” on one of their trains near Spofford, Texas. Agents responded to the train’s location and began a search, according to information obtained from Del Rio Sector Border Patrol officials.

During the search of the train, the agents found a man hiding between two rail cars. The agents interviewed the man and identified him as 44-year-old Leonardo Matias Carrasco. The agents determined the Mexican man entered the U.S. illegally. The agents transported the man to the Brackettville Station for medical screening and background investigation.

During a records check, the agents learned that a court in Texas convicted Carrasco for a 1998 murder in Tennessee Colony. The Texas court sentenced the Mexican man to five years in prison. Four years later, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) officers deported Carrasco to Mexico at the Hidalgo, Texas, border crossing.

Carrasco now faces new felony federal charges for illegal re-entry after removal as a convicted felon. If convicted on the new charge, he could face up to 20 years in federal prison.

Under Title 42 Coronavirus protection protocols put in place by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, most apprehended migrants are transported to rally points where they undergo a medical screening and criminal background investigation. Once cleared, they are expelled to Mexico. Most are expelled within two hours of their apprehension, Border Patrol officials told Breitbart Texas.

The agent seized more than 100 pounds of methamphetamine being carried by the “drug mules.”

Tucson Sector agents patrolling near the village of Vaya Chin, Arizona, on Sunday morning encountered three men they suspected to be illegal immigrants, according to information obtained from Border Patrol officials. The three men were wearing backpacks while hiking through the desert.

The agents interviewed the three men and identified them as Mexican nationals illegally present in the United States. A search of the backpacks led to the discovery of small packages containing what the agents believed to be drugs.

The agents then arrested the three illegal aliens and transported them to the station for processing. A test identified the drugs as being positive for the “characteristics of methamphetamine,” officials reported. The smuggled drugs weighed in excess of 100 pounds, officials stated.

Border Patrol officials turned the drugs and the three Mexican nationals over to ICE Homeland Security Investigations agents for further investigation and preparation of charges under drug smuggling and immigration violation charges.

“U.S. Border Patrol’s mission is to protect our nation’s borders,” officials said in a written statement. “Thanks to the vigilance and dedication of Tucson Sector Border Patrol agents, the dangerous drugs seized in this incident will not hit the streets of our nation.”

The agents interviewed the man and determined he was illegally present in the United States. After placing the migrant under arrest for an immigration violation, agents learned about additional migrants who were located in a nearby hotel.

Border Patrol agents traveled to the hotel and encountered five male subjects believed to be illegally present in the U.S., officials reported. Three of the subjects took off on foot in an attempt to avoid apprehension. Agents quickly apprehended two of the subjects — the third fled into a wooded area.

Agents called for support in finding the escaped subject. Responding agencies included the New York State Police, Erie County Sheriff’s Office, and the Grand Island Police Department, officials reported. A search of the area lasting multiple hours concluded with the arrest of the third subject.

The arrest of the blogger, who comes from a cartel-linked family, followed a verbal confrontation with police at a checkpoint after he videoed the aftermath of a shootout.

The incident began earlier this week in the Mexican border city of Piedras Negras. A group of cartel gunmen attacked a group of police officers, setting off a series of shootouts through the streets of the border city. Local bloggers Juan Nelsio “El Valeador” Espinoza Menera and Nestor Guerra were allegedly videotaping police activities after the shootout when they came across a police checkpoint in the Villa Del Carmen neighborhood.

Espinoza Menera is the nephew of jailed top Los Zetas cartel regional boss Daniel “El Dany” Menera who, before his arrest, controlled most of Coahuila for the drug cartel. El Valeador is also the nephew of failed mayoral candidate Lorenzo Menera who has a history of calling out alleged cases of police brutality by state authorities.

According to information released by the Coahuila government, both men got down from their vehicle appeared to be under the influence of alcohol when they “attacked both verbally and physically” the police officers who were at the checkpoint.

The police officers arrested the two men and were in the process of taking them to the Attorney General’s Office when Espinoza Menera began to show problems breathing. Authorities took him to a local hospital. Doctors declared the individual dead upon arrival, the government statement revealed.

In the aftermath of the case, Coahuila’s Attorney General Gerardo Marquez Guevara revealed that the cause of death was ruled as death by bronchial aspiration. The top state prosecutor revealed that the case was still under investigation.

The National Hurricane Center has forecasted “unsurvivable storm surge” from Hurricane #Laura in parts of Louisiana and Texas. Do NOT underestimate this storm. This is what that kind of water height looks like: pic.twitter.com/ik7EtpFTzn — The Weather Channel (@weatherchannel) August 26, 2020

The 7 p.m. statement reports:

The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to the right of the landfall location, where the surge will be accompanied by large and destructive waves. Unsurvivable storm surge with large and destructive waves will cause catastrophic damage from Sea Rim State Park, Texas, to Intracoastal City, Louisiana, including Calcasieu and Sabine Lakes. This surge could penetrate up to 40 miles inland from the immediate coastline, and flood waters will not fully recede for several days after the storm. Surge-related flooding depends on the relative timing of the surge and the tidal cycle, and can vary greatly over short distances. For information specific to your area, please see products issued by your local National Weather Service forecast office.

Officials forecast “catastrophic wind damage” in addition to the potentially fatal storm surge. Hurricane-force and tropical-storm-force winds are expected to move inland with the storm overnight and well into Thursday morning.

She stands accused of killing a Nuevo Laredo area prosecutor and several aides.

This week, a state judge in Tamaulipas formally charged Guadalupe “La Teniente” Gomez Villarreal with one count of murder and ordered that she be held without bond. Gomez Villarreal, a former Tamaulipas police officer, is one of the top leaders within the Cartel Del Noreste faction of Los Zetas. The charges are tied to the January 2017 ambush murder of Ricardo Martinez Chavez, the regional head for the Tamaulipas Attorney General’s Office. Martinez Chavez and four of his assistants died. Authorities found a stack of cash next to the body, suggesting a bribe or statement made by the cartel.

Gomez Villarreal’s involvement is also suspected with a car crash that killed the head of Federal Police in Tamaulipas along with five top officials traveling in an armored SUV. That crash took place one day after the ambush attack. Breitbart Texas consulted with federal law enforcement sources who revealed that at the time of the crash, authorities found road spikes.

The Mexican federal law enforcement source revealed that months prior to her arrest, La Teniente began to lose power and influence within the CDN as evidenced by her cartel’s lacking response to her capture. In previous arrest operations targeting the CDN, armored cartel convoys clashed with authorities as a matter of retaliation. La Teniente saw no such reaction.

The Mexican federal law enforcement sources also theorize that someone within the CDN tipped law enforcement to La Teniente’s location.

The seizure came at an interior immigration checkpoint in Southern California.

Agents assigned to the Highway 86 interior immigration checkpoint on Sunday morning observed a black Nissan Versa approaching for inspection. During the initial interview and screening, a Border Patrol K-9 alerted to the presence of an odor it is trained to detect, according to information provided to Breitbart Texas by El Centro Sector Border Patrol officials.

The agents referred the woman to a secondary inspection station where they conducted a physical search of the vehicle. During the search, the agents found 60 bundles of a white crystalline substance wrapped in tape and hidden in the floorboards, back seat, and rocker panels of the Nissan SUV, officials stated.

Agents tested the contents of the bundles and determined it to be consistent with methamphetamine. Officials reported the weight of the seized drugs as 148.61 pounds. They estimated the street value to be more than $334,000.

The Border Patrol agents arrested the 28-year-old female U.S. citizen and took her to the detention center for processing. They went on to seize the drugs and the vehicle.

A Texas DPS trooper stopped an un-refrigerated commercial box truck for a traffic violation on the afternoon of August 19. During the traffic stop, the trooper observed a group of people attempting to hide in the hot cargo area of the truck, according to information obtained from U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials.

The trooper requested assistance from Border Patrol agents to identify the subjects locked in the cargo area of the box truck. McAllen Station Border Patrol agents responded and identified the 15 people in the back of the truck as illegal immigrants. The agents placed them under arrest for immigration violations while the DPS trooper arrested the driver and seized the box truck, officials stated.

Questioning of the migrants led to the discovery of a suspected human smuggling stash house in Mission, Texas. The troopers and Border Patrol agents went to the residence and discovered 11 more illegal immigrants.

During the preceding three days, Border Patrol agents disrupted five additional human smuggling attempts. These interdictions led to the arrest of the human smugglers and the apprehension of 23 more migrants, officials reported.

In total, the Rio Grande Valley Sector Border Patrol agents arrested 50 migrants during the failed human smuggling attempts last week.

Elsewhere in Texas, Del Rio Sector Border Patrol agents teamed up with Texas DPS troopers to stop 12 human smuggling attempts during a two-day period, Breitbart Texas reported. The interdictions led to the arrests of 14 smugglers and the apprehension of 48 additional migrants.

Under Title 42 Coronavirus protection protocols put in place by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, agents conduct a medical screening and criminal background investigation on all of all apprehended migrants. Once cleared, most are expelled to Mexico within two hours, according to CBP officials.

The alleged human smugglers now face charges under 8 USC 1324 — Alien Smuggling. If convicted on the federal felony charges, each smuggler could face up to 10 years in prison, the report concludes.

The area is well known as a narcotics and human smuggling corridor for the Gulf Cartel. They observed 11 people on the Mexican side of the river approaching the bank. Agents also noticed them carrying nine large bundles. As they entered the river and crossed the Rio Grande, the suspects hastily approached a white SUV parked on the U.S. side and began loading the vehicle.

Once loaded, the vehicle quickly fled the scene toward a warehouse. Agents were able to arrest four suspects at the location and seized all nine bundles later determined to be 347 pounds of marijuana.

Agents also found the suspects had a pistol, extra ammunition, and $12,757 in U.S. cash.

Breitbart Texas spoke with an agent about the incident who stated the U.S. Attorney’s Office refused to accept charges in the case. As a result, agents notified the Starr Country Sheriff’s Office for jurisdiction and charging.

The agent stated it is common for U.S. prosecutors to decline charges due to the overwhelming number of busts in conjunction with smaller drug loads seized. Border Patrol agents are routinely forced to contact local and state law enforcement agencies to take jurisdiction.

Outside temperatures in the area reached well above 100 degrees.

Agents assigned to the Interstate 19 immigration checkpoint near Amado, Arizona, on Wednesday afternoon observed a Chevrolet Malibu approaching for inspection. The agents referred the driver, a Tucson man, to the secondary station, according to information obtained from Tucson Sector Border Patrol officials.

The agents searched the vehicle and found three people packed into the trunk of the Malibu. The agents interviewed the three men and identified them as Guatemalan nationals who entered the United States illegally. The agents arrested the driver and the three illegal immigrants.

At about the same time, agents witnessed two men illegally crossing the U.S. border from Mexico by climbing over an old section of fencing. This section has not yet been replaced by the new bollard wall technology being deployed along the southern border, officials reported.

A short time later, agents assigned to the State Route 85 immigration checkpoint observed a Chevrolet Impala approaching for inspection. The agents searched the vehicle and found a Honduran man and a Guatemalan woman packed into the trunk of the Impala.

Agents arrested the female driver and her female passenger, both from Tucson, on charges related to smuggling illegal immigrants. They also arrested the two migrants on immigration violations.

Officials said the outside temperature in the area of both human smuggling incidents was about 105 degrees. Despite the intense heat in the trunks of the vehicles, none of the five arrested migrants required additional medical attention.

Despite the threat of the Coronavirus, none of the people locked in the trunks of the vehicles were provided personal protection equipment, officials stated.

Under Title 42 Coronavirus protection protocols put in place by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, nearly all apprehended migrants are transported to rally points. There, the migrants undergo a medical screening and criminal background before being expelled to Mexico. CBP officials report nearly all are expelled within about two hours of their apprehension.

“Tucson Sector Border Patrol would like to remind the public that hiding people in a vehicle’s trunk is a cruel tactic, especially during summer months,” officials said in a written statement. “Those inside can suffer heat-related illness, asphyxiation from a lack of oxygen, and serious injury or death in the event of a collision.”

The smugglers attempted to use the cover of darkness to move the migrants in a panga from Mexico to California.

A U.S. Customs and Border Protection Air and Marine Operations (AMO) aircrew onboard a Multi-role Enforcement Aircraft on the night of August 20 detected a single-engine boat headed from Mexico to California. The aircrew relayed information about the panga to a San Diego Air and Marine Branch (SDAMB) Coastal Interceptor Vessel crew and guided them to the location of the now-failed smuggling incident, according to information obtained from U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials.

The interceptor crew interdicted the Mexican panga and attempted to stop the vessel by activating their lights and siren. The captain of the small boat failed to stop and continued on. The CBP AMO crew fired “disabling rounds” into the engine of the fleeing human smuggler’s panga bringing the chase to a successful conclusion about 12 miles off the coast of Carlsbad, California.

The AMO agents boarded the craft and found nine subjects on board. They towed the disabled craft to the harbor and turned the nine subjects over to awaiting U.S. Border Patrol agents. The agents took custody of the occupants and transported them to the station for processing and further investigation.

“AMO agents and our Regional Law Enforcement partners remain vigilant, committed and focused on detecting, intercepting and disrupting smuggling attempts off the Southern California coast, San Diego Air and Marine Branch Director Timothy Sutherland said in a written statement. “This interdiction is another example of AMO’s unique capabilities, which combines technology, aviation, and maritime assets and the training and expertise of our dedicated agents.”

So far this fiscal year, which began on October 1, 2019, SDAMB agents assisted in the apprehension of 2,618 people, CBP officials stated. In addition to its impact on offshore human smuggling, the agents also contributed to the seizure of 480 pounds of cocaine, 199,307 pounds of marijuana, 191 pounds of fentanyl, 114 pounds of heroin, 2,948 pounds of methamphetamine, 80 weapons, and 81 vehicles/vessels.

The county judge from Williamson County said the $150 million budget cut to the Austin Police Department by the city council places Austin officers and their families “in great peril.” Part of Austin extends into Williamson County.

County Judge Bill Gravell, Jr. noted that 55,385 residents of the county live within Austin’s city limits. The county judge told Governor Abbott, “I am concerned with these extreme budget cuts, that the citizens of the City of Austin within Williamson County will not remain protected at current levels.” In Texas, a county judge is the chief executive of the local government.

Gravell added, “It is clear the Austin City Council has abdicated their responsibility to protect their citizens and, in turn, citizens of Williamson County. I will not let politics get in the way of protecting the people.”

Governor Abbott responded to the Austin City Council’s $150 police department cut saying, “Some cities are more focused on political agendas than public safety.”

Abbott said the action “paves the way for lawlessness,” reported Breitbart Texas.

The Austin-area county judge wrote Governor Abbott, “as you are assigning State Troopers to fill in the void in law enforcement in Austin, that you would assign additional Troopers to work with our [Sheriff] to protect our Austin area citizens.”

Williamson County Sheriff Robert Chody responded to the county judge’s letter request by tweeting, “Austin politics to impact WilCo.”

On Saturday, Sheriff Chody told Breitbart Texas the Austin police budget cuts could have adverse effects on the county where he serves as the chief law enforcement officer.

“Taking away replacement officers [by defunding three police academy classes and eliminating 150 vacant officer positions] only to be filled by other needed units that investigate or fight certain crime trends will certainly diminish services that will negatively impact Wilco public safety.”

When the city council made the cuts, Austin City Councilman Greg Casar said the decision was “born out of a lot of hurt in the community.” “We know we have a long way to go.”

District 6 Councilman Flannigan wrote in his plan posted on AustinCouncilForum.org: “We should expedite the demolition of the APD Headquarters by directing the City Manager to move all remaining APD staff out of the existing headquarters building and into other underutilized city facilities.”

The city council plans to cut the Austin Police Department budget by one-third and redirect some of the funds to abortion and food programs.

Governor Abbott promised that “the Texas Department of Public Safety will stand in the gap to protect our city.”

Breitbart Texas recently reported that the City of Austin became number one in Texas in the percentage increase in the number of murders. The number of murders in the city rose by 64 percent in a year-to-year comparison, Governor Abbott stated. The report cited by the governor also revealed a 14 percent increase in aggravated robberies while other robberies increased by 16 percent.

The Texas governor met the city council’s action with a call for legislation to freeze the property tax revenue of any city acting to “defund police,” Breitbart Texas reported. Lt. Governor Dan Patrick pledged to make this a priority in next year’s legislative session. Austin experienced protests and some rioting in recent weeks and one person was killed after shots were exchanged during a Black Lives Matter protest downtown. Patrick said recent events did not devolve into anarchy like Portland and Seatle “because of our Department of Public Safety troopers.”",Texas County Requests Help from State Troopers After Austin Defunds Police,fake

Del Rio Sector agents joined forces on August 14 and 15 with Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS) troopers, Edwards County Sheriff’s Office deputies and agents from U.S. Customs and Border Protection’s Air and Marine Operations to stop human smugglers in their tracks, according to information obtained from Border Patrol officials.

Del Rio Station agents patrolling the border near the town of Del Rio, Texas, on August 14 observed a group of suspected illegal aliens climb into a pickup truck located on Highway 277, officials reported. The agents conducted a traffic stop on the pickup truck and interviewed the driver and passenger. The agent identified the driver and a U.S. citizen and the passenger as a Mexican national with Legal Permanent Resident status. The couple was accompanied by their two minor children.

The agents also identified two other people in the vehicle as Mexican nationals illegally present in the United States, officials stated.

The following day, Del Rio Station agents received a call for assistance from a Texas DPS trooper. The trooper attempted to stop a vehicle and the driver failed to yield. The driver of the vehicle led police on a chase that reached speeds in excess of 100 miles per hour, officials reported.

Edwards County Sheriff’s Office deputies deployed a controlled tire deflation device to end the pursuit. Police arrested all eight occupants of the vehicle.

The trooper identified the driver as a U.S. citizen and took him into custody. Responding Border Patrol agents identified the other seven occupants of the vehicle as illegal aliens, officials stated. The agents said one of the occupants was a seven-year-old Honduran national.

The stopping of human smuggling attempts continued leading to the arrest of 14 human smugglers. Officials report nine of the smugglers as U.S. citizens — the remaining five were Cuban and Mexican nationals. The agents also processed 48 migrants from Mexico, El Salvador, Honduras, Guatemala, and Cuba.

“We’re taking Alice from a commutation to a full pardon,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office on Friday afternoon.

“I’m excited right now, and we’re very proud about the job you’ve done and what you represent,” the president said.

In 2018, Trump granted Johnson a commutation from her life sentence after she served 21 years for a first-time nonviolent drug offense. But on Friday, he announced that he believed she deserved a full pardon.

Trump said he did not discuss the idea prior to her convention speech on Thursday night but that he was inspired after he spotted her in the audience the night of his convention speech at the White House.

“I just told her. We didn’t even discuss it. We just — you were out there,” Trump said to Johnson. “I saw you in the audience last night, and I asked the folks if you could bring Alice over. We’re going to give a full pardon.”

The president did not campaign on the issue of criminal justice reform but was inspired on the issue after celebrity Kim Kardashian visited him at the White House to discuss it. With the support of a bipartisan coalition, Trump signed the First Step Act in December 2018.

During her RNC speech Thursday night, Johnson thanked the president for his mercy.

“I was once told that the only way I would ever be reunited with my family would be as a corpse,” Johnson said. “But by the grace of God and the compassion of President Donald John Trump, I stand before you tonight, and I assure you, I’m not a ghost.

The researchers claim that wastewater samples can identify the presence of a virus two to three weeks before residents test positive.

According to a local news report, researchers at the University of Arizona claim that they successfully thwarted the spread of coronavirus by testing wastewater samples. Administrators conducted 311 coronavirus tests on students in the Likins residential building after wastewater from the building was found to have contained traces of the virus.

Dr. Ian Pepper, an environmental science professor, claims that wastewater sampling can successfully prevent even individual cases of coronavirus. Unlike other statistical indicators of a virus’ presence in a community, wastewater sampling can directly prevent cases.

“By analyzing the sewage, we’re actually monitoring the whole community with one test,” Pepper said. “That gives you seven precious days in which you can put in mitigation or interventions to try to deal with the virus. I think about a week in the U.S. is probably equivalent to 20 or 30,000 cases,” Pepper added. Wastewater sampling has been used in Europe throughout the coronavirus pandemic. In a press release published in August, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention tempered expectations for wastewater sampling, claiming that it is an imperfect measure of a virus’ presence in a specific location.

“Sewage testing over time can provide trend data that can complement other surveillance data that informs public health decision making,” the CDC wrote in a press release. “However, at this time, it is not possible to reliably and accurately predict the number of infected individuals in a community based on sewage testing.”

Although the spike may indicate the virus’ tendency to spread in densely populated communities, experts claim that young people are unlikely to face serious health repercussions after contracting the virus.

According to a report by CBS News, the University of Alabama has reported more than 531 positive coronavirus tests across its several campuses. Now, university officials are scrambling to prevent further spreading.

University of Alabama President Stuart Bell said during a conference that the spike in the number of potential cases on campus is “unacceptable.” Bell suggested that he would shut down the campus if cases continued to rise.

“Although our initial re-entry test was encouraging, the rise in COVID cases that we’ve seen in recent days is unacceptable and if unchecked threatens our ability to complete the semester on campus,” Bell said.

In response to the development, the mayor of Tuscaloosa, Alabama, announced that all bars will be closed for the next two weeks to mitigate the spread. Last Friday, the university announced that students will not be permitted to gather outside of the classroom for the next two weeks.

Statistics suggest that young people are unlikely to face serious health ramifications if they contract the virus.

Dr. Anthony Fauci criticized young people in July, chiding them for not following guidelines to fight the Chinese virus. According to Fauci, young people are less concerned about coronavirus because they usually have mild symptoms, but can spread it to at-risk individuals. He told Marketwatch, “You don’t realize, probably innocently, that you are inadvertently propagating the outbreak. You are becoming part of the problem because, even if you get infected without any symptoms, it is likely that you are going to infect someone else.”

“The percentage of symptomatic cases requiring hospitalisation is estimated to be 0.1% for children aged 0 to 9 and 0.3% among those aged 10 to 19, compared to a hospitalisation rate of over 4% in the UK for the general population,” Phil Kerpen tweeted this week. “Most of these children make a rapid recovery.”

Although the students will be unable to access the campus, they will still be permitted to attend class remotely. The university announced that it has labeled the students “persona non grata.” The move comes just a week after the school placed nine fraternities and sororities on interim suspension for violating policies.

According to a local news report, the University of Pittsburgh suspended eight students this week over their refusal to comply with coronavirus mitigation policies. Two weeks after students returned to campus, the University of Pittsburgh, which as nearly 30,000 students, has reported just 11 positive cases.

University spokesperson Kevin Zwick announced that the university suspended eight students this week over violation of mitigation policies. Zwick did not provide details on how the students violated the policies.

“Pitt has placed eight students on interim persona non grata status, meaning these students are restricted from campus and all university facilities,” Zwick said. “These students can still take classes remotely.”

Zwick said that the university will continue to sanction students that violate mitigation policy. “While this figure shows the majority of Pitt students are respecting health and safety guidelines, the university will continue to take action when bad behavior puts our campus community at risk,” Zwick said.

The RA’s participated in a two-week training session this month to learn about new policies adopted by the university to mitigate the spread of the virus.

According to a local news report, residential assistants at Thomas College in Waterville, Maine, will be tasked with monitoring violations of the college’s new coronavirus mitigation policies. Students have been asked to limit social gatherings and wear masks in all common spaces.

Dean of Students Hannah Gladstone said that the college’s residential assistants are prepared to hold students accountable if they violate university policy.

“They receive two weeks of fall leadership training this year to include a lot more in regards to COVID. We have made our residents aware of new policies going into this year …” Gladstone wrote in an email. “Our RA team is learning about both the new policies and strategies they can implement to confront and hold their peers accountable. Likewise, they are also learning about ways that they can help empower their residents to hold each other accountable.

Gladstone subtly suggested that students would be suspended if they violate the university’s mitigation policies. Students were asked to pledge compliance to the policies upon their return to campus.

“Our role on campus will be to look out for and protect the health and safety of our community,” Gladstone continued. “If students are not able or choose not to follow the pledge, we will consider that perhaps this may not be the semester that they should be back on campus. The health and safety of our campus is dependent on our students following the pledge they sign and looking out for one another.”

To the Kenosha Police Department, if you do not name the officer who brutally shot Jacob Blake on Sunday, we will simply begin naming officers from your department who may or may not be him,” said King in a tweet.

According to a report by the Hill, Boston University announced this week that it will suspend students that attend large parties.

In a statement that was published on Wednesday, Dean Kenneth Elmore encouraged students to remind their peers to follow the guidelines.

“If you observe someone you believe is a member of the Boston University community not wearing a face covering, face mask, or respecting physical distancing, say something! Ask them to pull up the face covering or mask or to give a little more space,” the statement reads. “I find that a reminder from someone within the community is a good enough nudge for me to do the right thing.”

Elmore also provided students with a 24-hour hotline number that they can call to report students that are violating the university’s policy against large gatherings. Dean Elmore ended his message by expressing hope that he won’t have to suspend any students for violating the policy.

“I hope that I will not have to suspend anyone, and I know if we all work together, and remain committed to our goal of maintaining a healthy living and learning environment, we can and we will do this,” Elmore wrote.

Rushmore speech earlier this year.

If the phrase “cancel culture” has a drawback, it is that it is too modern — “cultural revolution” is a better phrase, correctly conjuring images of its historical antecedent in Mao’s Communist China.

That is, in fact, what we are living through — Americans across the country are experiencing incidents in their workplaces, in their colleges, and even out in public — that are virtually indistinguishable from Maoist “struggle sessions.”

If you’re berated in your workplace or in public, you may be one of the lucky ones — at least your business isn’t being burned down or looted. At least you aren’t being beaten to near-death by rioters.

The source of the poison is higher education, where far-left professors pass the doctrine of cultural revolution on to the next generation. Here, the government has a considerable degree of power. To begin healing the nation, President Trump simply has to follow through on his warning to defund higher education institutions that indoctrinate and radicalize America’s students.

… and/or Funding, which will be taken away if this Propaganda or Act Against Public Policy continues. Our children must be Educated, not Indoctrinated! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 10, 2020

Another power center of the cultural revolution is corporate America, which many Republicans still believe is their ally. President Trump, as always, is ahead of the curve, calling for a boycott of tire manufacturer Goodyear for instructing its employees that the slogans “Make America Great Again” and “Blue Lives Matter” and “political” materials are unacceptable among its employees, while “Black Lives Matter” and LGBT Pride are acceptable.

Under fire from Trump, Goodyear lamely argued that there’s a difference between “political” activity and “racial injustice and other equity issues.”

Mao’s Red Guards probably didn’t think their values were “political” either.

Clearly, corporations cannot be trusted to define what is a “political” activity. We’ve seen it with Goodyear, we’ve seen it with Big Tech — left to their own devices they will march to the drum of their most radical left-wing employees.

A major step in Republicans shedding their 1980s laissez-faire orthodoxies must be a serious effort to define what corporate “political” activities actually are, and impose strict restrictions on them. If corporations are allowed to continue sending billions of dollars to “social justice” campaigns, the cultural revolution will continue.

Republicans must target not just corporate donations to parties, PACs, and political candidates, but also impose regulations on the ever-broadening field of “Corporate Social Responsibility,” the banner under which most corporate wokeness operates.

Democrats were once the party that opposed corporate dominance in politics. Republicans must seize that mantle.

Republicans must also tackle the question of corporate racism. Why are corporations allowed to openly belittle and demonize their white employees, bombarding them with presentations redefining everyday behavior and character traits as signs of “white privilege” and “white supremacy”? Breitbart News exclusively such activities occurring at one of the largest and most powerful PR firms in the world, Publicis Groupe.

Questions need to be asked: why aren’t these companies facing lawsuits for their open racism? Does the existing framework of Civil Rights law only protect some races from discrimination and not others? Does the law need to be changed?

When there is a serious risk of more class-action lawsuits like the Damore case against Google, in which former employees sued the company for discrimination against whites, males, and Asians, corporate America will get the message.

Democrats have abandoned the principles of equality before the law and freedom from discrimination, two values with enduring appeal to Americans of every race and background. Here again is an opportunity for Republicans.

In truth, with polls consistently showing widespread public opposition to racist leftist policies like affirmative action, it has been an opportunity for some time — Republican leaders have just been too cowardly or too indoctrinated by elite higher education institutions to seize it. They need to stiffen their spines.

Thanks to Trump, opposition “cancel culture” has become a major talking point among Republicans. Even neocons like Nikki Haley are talking about it. To ensure it becomes more than just a campaign slogan, conservatives inside and outside the Republican apparatus should start thinking about concrete policies to bring this destructive, racist, cultural revolution to its well-deserved end.

“To the Kenosha Police Department, If you do not name the officer who brutally shot Jacob Blake on Sunday, we will simply begin naming officers from your department who may or may not be him,” King tweeted from his verified account. “Fuck it.

Later on in the thread, King names and shares a photo of at least one Kenosha officer, wondering whether he is one of the cops seen in a video of the Blake shooting.

According to some reports, after three nights of rioting at the hands of the left-wing terrorists aligned with Black Lives Matter and Antifa, half of downtown Kenosha is already lost — burned, looted, razed. This little city of 100,00 is decimated.

And today, people are dead.

As I write this, we have no idea if the shooting of Blake was justified or not. A video that purports to show what happened on the other side of the car, the side we could not see in the original shooting video, appears to show Blake struggling with officers.

We still don’t know if Blake was reaching for a weapon when he was shot or if the officer feared he was.

When the rioting first broke out in Kenosha Sunday night, King tweeted that he refused to call for peace in Kenosha. “[M]ayhem is the consequence,” he said. “You earned it.”

And now King’s ready to dox innocent cops, threatening to publicize their names, to throw them and their families to the wolves, to paint targets on the backs of innocent men and women and children who will no doubt be personally terrorized at home, as will their families.

Nevertheless, Twitter allows King to not only do this but to call for violence against the Christian Church, which he did just days before a dozen or so churches around the country were desecrated and vandalized.

“Yes, I think the statues of the white European they claim is Jesus should also come down,” he tweeted in June. “Tear them down.”

So what we have here is more proof that traditional Americans and conservatives are second-class citizens in our own country. Shaun King can openly promote violence, openly threaten to dox, openly blackmail… Nothing happens to him. Twitter allows him to continue. The corporate media encourage him, either with accolades and publicity or by ignoring him, pretending he is not out there stoking violence and mayhem.

But if you and I stand by the scientific fact that a man is a man, no matter what, we are evicted from the public square of Twitter, we become CNNLOL’s villain of the say, the target of their “Two Minutes Hate.”

This is not a drill.

Remember, the police are not the real targets in all of this.

You and I are the targets.

The police are just in the way of getting to you and I.

Prepare yourselves.

According to a Texas A&M dean that commented to Campus Reform, the university’s Office of Risk, Ethics, and Compliance is leading the probe of Castro’s behavior.

Breitbart News reported last week that Castro had faced scrutiny over a series of bizarre Facebook posts about President Trump. In one strange post, Castro described a personal fantasy during which President Trump suffers a heart attack.

“I always though [sic] that this was going to have a normal end, with Trump having a heart attack on top of his daughter and crushing her with his fat, and Kushner having to try to resuscitate her (for the money) from drawing in trump’s vomit of Pepsi and half-chewed chicken nuggets, swallowed in big chucks…,” Castro wrote.

Castro called President Trump a “fat klansmen” and suggested that senior Trump advisors should be locked away “in some institution.” In another post, Castro said that he hopes President Trump and Vice President Pence contract the Chinese virus. Castro also said that it was “good news” that Representative Louie Gohmert (R-TX) had tested positive for the virus.

In a statement published on Friday, Texas A&M condemned professors for using vulgar language on social media. The university claimed that academic freedom does not give professors a license to engage in speech that is designed to “destroy” the community.

We have not seen enough civil discourse around campus lately. To that end, the board strongly condemns the recent vulgar, disrespectful and divisive language of a few members of the faculty at the flagship university in Bryan-College Station. We expect – and know – our faculty to be among the best in the nation and to exercise the academic freedom that comes with being a member of this great university. That freedom, however, does not include speech that is full of hate and serves to destroy our campus community. Aggies should not tolerate such divisive behavior, and we should hold each other accountable to preserve the spirit that generations of Aggies have forged for us.

Benjamin O’Keefe, a former staffer for Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and the far-left organization Move On (and, according to his Twitter bio, a “trans-inclusive intersectional feminist” with “he/him/his” pronouns), also attacked Sandmann during the speech, mocking his physical appearance.

In January, CNN had to settle with Sandmann in a lawsuit filed alleging that it and many other establishment and left-wing media outlets defamed him during “Covingtongate” in 2019.

CNN, together with other mainstream media journalists, whipped themselves into a hate-frenzy against the then-high school student in January 2018, after he was videoed wearing a MAGA hat while smiling sheepishly as a far-left Native American activist confronted him during a pro-life rally in Washington D.C. The media falsely characterized the teenagers as “harassing” the activist.

The result was a whirlwind of hate from celebrities and “verified” liberal users on social media, with many threatening violence against Sandmann and his classmates. None lost their Twitter accounts as a result of this incitement.

In his RNC speech, Sandmann condemned the media, arguing that they were willing to ruin a teenager’s life to score points against the MAGA movement:

Being from Kentucky, the birth place of Abraham Lincoln, my classmates and I visited the Lincoln Memorial. I found myself face-to-face with Nathan Phillips and other professional protesters looking to turn me into the latest poster child showing why Trump is bad. While the media portrayed me as the aggressor with a “relentless smirk” on my face, in reality the video confirms I was standing with my hands behind my back and an awkward smile on my face that hid two thoughts: One, don’t do anything that might further agitate the man banging a drum in my face and two, trying to follow a family friend’s advice never to do anything to embarrass your family, your school, or your community. Before I knew what was happening, it was over. One of Mr. Phillips fellow agitators yelled out “We got him!”, “It’s all right here on video” and We won Grandpa”. What I thought was a strange encounter, quickly developed into a major news story complete with video footage. My life changed forever in that one moment. The full war machine of the mainstream media revved up into attack mode. They did so without ever researching the full video of the incident; without ever investigating Mr. Philips’ motives; or without ever asking me for my side of the story. And do you know why? Because the truth wasn’t important. Advancing their anti-Christian, anti-Conservative, anti-Donald Trump narrative was all that mattered. And if advancing their narrative ruined the reputation and future of a teenager from Covington, Kentucky … so be it. That will teach him not to wear a MAGA hat!

U.S. Attorney Ryan K. Patrick said that China is building its economy with resources from other nations. Patrick claims that the United States government will continue to hold foreign researchers accountable if they attempt to funnel research back into their home country.

“China is building an economy and academic institutions with bricks stolen from others all around the world,” Patrick wrote. “While 1.4 million foreign researchers and academics are here in the U.S. for the right reasons, the Chinese Talents Program exploits our open and free universities. These conflicts must be disclosed, and we will hold those accountable when such conflict violates the law.”

Assistant Attorney General for National Security John C. Demers claims that the Chinese government has continued to use the Thousand Talents Program to exploit research from universities and colleges around the globe.

“Once again, we have witnessed the criminal consequences that can arise from undisclosed participation in the Chinese government’s talent program. Professor Cheng allegedly made false statements to his university and to NASA regarding his affiliations with the Chinese government. The Department of Justice will continue seeking to bring participation in these talent programs to light and to expose the exploitation of our nation and our prized research institutions,” Demers said.

Texas A&M University Chancellor John Sharp said that the university is working with the FBI to ensure that the United States is prepared to prevent further attempts by foreign agents to steal research.

“We worked closely with the FBI on this case, and we gladly will work with them again as needed,” Sharp stated. “No one in higher education takes security as seriously as we do at The Texas A&M University System. In fact, we have received several awards from the Department of Defense’s Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency, including one just last month.”

Breitbart News reported in January that four researchers at the University of Florida were forced to resign after it was alleged that they were funneling research to the Chinese government.

The University of Notre Dame suspended in-person classes last week after a spike in positive coronavirus cases.

In a letter to the editor published on Tuesday, five professors at the University of Notre Dame urged administrators to keep the campus open for the remainder of the academic year. The professors argue that students experience significant benefits from the on-campus learning experience.

A new danger stalks the world, and it is not clear when we will have it under control. Nevertheless, we think the right decision is to have students learn and live together in person. We recognize there are some risks, especially to faculty and staff, but we do not think they are high enough to deprive students of the opportunities we were fortunate enough to enjoy at their age. Our society has already made young people sacrifice so much during the pandemic. Based on our understanding of the risks and present situation, we think shuttering the campus indefinitely and banishing students to isolated online learning would be unjust.

The letter highlights statistics that suggest that young people are not likely to face serious health ramifications when they contract the virus. They referenced a study that concluded that students may be safest on campus, in part, due to the psychological distress that is associated with quarantining in one’s home.

The professors argue that closing campus until a vaccine is available would jeopardize the economic well-being of campus staff. Moreover, students will be forced to endure a lower-quality learning experience.

The economic consequences of closing campus until we have a vaccine could jeopardize the job security and financial stability of many of our staff. And by sending students back home, we risk that they will have an atomized, isolated educational experience that it is a poor substitute for in-person learning, discussion and personal formation. One cannot experience a dorm mass, ramble the quad in deep discussion, develop new friendships or march for a cause while on Zoom.

Breitbart News reported last week that the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and the University of Notre Dame both suspended in-person classes due to a spike in positive coronavirus cases. Although 146 students at Notre Dame tested positive for the virus, none have required hospitalization.

The Global Times piece is part of Communist China’s perpetual propaganda effort to paint itself as the hapless victim of the offenses it perpetrates against the rest of the world. China is ground zero for cyberwarfare, waging relentless hacking attacks against the rest of the planet and stealing trillions of dollars of intellectual property.

Beijing’s latest cyberattacks included massive campaigns against the Taiwanese government and its semiconductor industry. In the United States, indictments have been filed against a string of alleged Chinese agents who stole valuable government, academic, and corporate data.

With the heat turned up against Chinese espionage, the Communist Party is using its media apparatus to paint the United States as the real menace in cyberspace. The Global Times even managed to loop Taiwan into the great cyber-conspiracy against poor, innocent Beijing:

In 2019 alone, there were three major cyberattacks related to the US. In March 2019, Venezuela’s national power grid collapsed. The country’s president denounced the attack as a well planned cyberattack by the US. This indicates that cyberwarfare has become a new mode of undeclared warfare – an invisible invasion of sorts. In June 2019, Trump announced retaliation against Iran with a cyberattack too. This showed that cyberwarfare has moved from the backstage to the front lines, from covert warfare to a declaration of war, and from auxiliary fighting to mainstream combat. On November 4, 2019, the US invited a number of countries to hold the first ever joint cyberattack and defense exercise with the island of Taiwan. It undertook cyberattack scenarios as a new approach to go beyond beach landings and targeting financial systems. It focused on persistent and chaotic destructive attacks on key infrastructure and economic systems. This indicates that the US has crossed the bottom line of the one-China principle in cyberspace.

This was topped off by repeating some unsubstantiated rumors that U.S. and Israeli intelligence were behind the rash of early summer fires in Iran.

The Global Times paradoxically accused the U.S. of trying to “disconnect” China from the Internet and shooting itself in the foot by sabotaging its own cyber-espionage plans by disconnecting China.

Even though disconnection would theoretically make China safer from those hypothetical American gremlins, the Global Times took the possibility as a signal for China to step up its “deterrence” efforts against virtual warfare, including its nuclear deterrence.

“China not only needs to be capable of launching counterattacks in cyberspace, but also must consider special situations in which other countries’ cyberattacks might affect our ability of a nuclear counterattack. We must keep nuclear deterrence to the cyberattacks that aim to paralyze our network,” the article concluded, favorably citing Russia’s defense doctrine, which threatens to respond with nuclear war if a cyberattack targeting its nuclear forces is detected.

Leaving the Chinese Communist Party’s saber-rattling aside, the question of deterrence is an interesting aspect of computer security. For decades, security analysts have wondered what could dissuade China, North Korea, Russia, and other bad actors from their relentless campaigns of theft and espionage. Many have hotly debated the practical and ethical considerations of drawing a line in the electronic sand and threatening real-world consequences for online mischief.

In theory, hacker attacks on vital infrastructure could be as destructive and deadly as terrorist bombings. The Global Times crafted its propaganda after U.S. and NATO concerns about hyperwar: the chilling and increasingly plausible theory that the next great war will be fought in physical and virtual space simultaneously, at blinding speed, making first-strike hacker attacks every bit as provocative and dangerous as first-strike missile attacks.",Chinese State Media: U.S. Cyber-Criminals Might Target Our Nuclear Arsenal,fake

A press release published on Monday claims that the gift will help increase the number of students from groups that have been “historically marginalized” by universities and colleges.

According to a press release, UC Berkeley has recently accepted a $24 million donation that will cover tuition costs for first-generation and low-income students. The university celebrated the donation by announcing that the funds will increase diversity in the student body.

The donation was made by the Haas family. Bob Haas, a UC Berkeley graduate, is the great-grandnephew of Levi Strauss, the first manufacturer of blue jeans. Haas served as chairman of Levi Strauss & Co. between 1989 and 2014.

Colleen Haas, who has focused her philanthropic efforts on social justice issues, said that she hopes the donation helps students from groups that have been “historically marginalized” by universities and colleges.

The press release highlights research conducted by recent UC Berkeley graduate Michael Cerda-Jara, a participant in the Haas Scholars Program. Cerda-Jara conducted research on the role that higher education can play in helping former criminals rejoin the labor market.

Cruz Grimaldo, director of Berkeley’s Financial Aid and Scholarships Office, claimed that the donation will help the university enroll exceptional first-generation students.

“These scholarships, fully matched at $20 million, will allow the university to welcome exceptional new first-generation students who might have otherwise not been able to attend Berkeley,” Grimaldo said. “These students are exceptional, and through this scholarship, we are able to tell them that they are what Berkeley wants.”

Bob Haas said in a statement that philanthropic giving has long been at the core of his family’s purpose. “My father, Walter A. Haas Jr., was president of Levi Strauss, and he would come home, but he never talked about business,” Haas said. “He was most proud of talking about the things that he was doing in the community.”

“The students in these programs inspire us as a result of their overcoming what their environment handed them,” Haas added. “And to achieve this, to make it into Berkeley, or to be the first in their families to go to college, is not only inspiring, it’s nothing short of amazing.”
