# fake-news-detection-
The aim of this project  is to walk you through the process of creating a machine learning model using python and NLP in order to successfully detect fake news.
Dataset
Acquiring a suitable dataset presents one of the most crucial components of any data-science endeavor. 
For this case scenario, the dataset used will contain a number of articles. 
These articles will have been pre-classified as “REAL” or “FAKE” (referring to their contents).
They will then be used as training data in order for the model to be able to determine whether an article presents factual information or simply fake news.
I used links of different sites to download articles from them.
Then i create a dataframe contains the title of each article and it's included text.
After making sure that my dataframe is clean i used different algorithms for modeling
